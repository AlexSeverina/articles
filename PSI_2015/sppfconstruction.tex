\section{Construction of Parse Forest Finite Representation}
The number of paths in input automaton graph is exponential and could be infinite,
thus, to be able to use parse forest in practice, some finite representation should 
be constructed. RNGLR-algorithm use Shared Packed Parse Forest (SPPF) presented by 
Rekers~\cite{SPPF} to compress the set of trees of possible derivations of input string. 
We inherit SPPF construction from RNGLR-algorithm, and in our case it merges derivation
trees for strings accumulated along some path in input graph. 

SPPF is a directed graph with the following structure: the root corresponds to the start
nonterminal of the grammar; vertices with no outgoing edges correspond to the terminals;
the rest of the vertices could be divided into 2 classes: nonterminal and production. 
Each nonterminal node have a \emph{family} (a collection) of production nodes, each of 
which present one of the possible derivations of the nonterminal. Production nodes 
representing righthand side of the production have an ordered collection of terminal or 
nonterminal nodes. The lenght of a collection could be equal to the lenght of the rule,
or less, if final symbols derive $\epsilon$: nullable symbols are ignored which help to
reduce memory consumption. 

SPPF and GSS are constructed simultaneously. Each edge of GSS is associated with some 
subgraph of SPPF. When new edge is added to GSS, either a graph with single terminal 
node is associated with the edge, or if this edge is added during reduction procession, 
a nonterminal node is created and correspondent production node is added. If the same 
nonterminal node has already been created in SPPF, the production is added to the its 
family.
