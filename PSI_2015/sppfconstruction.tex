\section{Construction of Parse Forest Finite Representation}
The forest of parse trees can have infinite size in case of infinite number of paths in 
the input graph, so some finite representation could be helpful for practical use. 
It is natural to use Shared Packed Parse Forest (SPPF) presented by Rekers~\cite{SPPF}
as such representation. SPPF is a directed graph which merge the nodes of 
derivation trees.
