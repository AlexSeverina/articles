\section{Correctness of the Algorithm}
\textsc{Theorem 1.}
\textit{For any given deterministic context-free grammar and any given nondeterministic
finite automaton with single start and single final state and with no $\epsilon$-transitions,
the algorithm terminates.}

\textsc{Proof.}
Each vertex of inner representation of the input finite automaton contains, at most, 
$N$ GSS vertices, where $N$ is a number of parser states, so for the inner graph which contains $n$
vertices, the number of GSS vertices is, at most, $Nn$. GSS has no multiple edges:
an edge $(v_{1}, v_{2})$ is only created if no edge exists between $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$,  
meaning, the number of edges is limited with $(Nn) \cdot (Nn - 1) / 2 $. 

The algorithm dequeues vertex to be processed from the queue $Q$ at each iteration of the 
main loop. Vertices are enqueued to $Q$ only if new edge is added to GSS. As a number of 
GSS edges is finite, the algorithm always terminates. 



\textsc{Definition.} 
\emph{Correct tree} is an ordered, rooted tree with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The root is the start nonterminal of the grammar $G$
  \item The leaf nodes are the terminals of $G$. The sequence of the leaf nodes 
        corresponds to a path in the inner graph. 
  \item The interior nodes are the nonterminals of $G$. The children of nonterminal 
        $N$ correspond to the symbols on the righthand side of some production for $N$ in $G$.
\end{enumerate}

\textsc{Theorem 2.} 
\textit{Every tree generated from SPPF is a correct tree.}

\textsc{Proof.} Let us consider some tree generated from SPPF and proof it is coorect. 
The first and the third items of the definition are true by consequence of SPPF definition.
For the proof of the second item, we would need the following lemma. 

\textsc{Lemma 1.}
For every GSS edge $(v_{t}, v_{h})$, $v_{t} \in V_{t}.processed$, 
       $v_{h} \in V_{h}.processed$, $\exists$ path $p$ from $V_{h}$ to $V_{t}$

\textsc{Proof.}



\textsc{Theorem 3.} \textit{For every path $p$ the in the inner graph, a correct tree corresponding to 
                            the $p$ could be generated from SPPF.}

\textsc{Proof.}
