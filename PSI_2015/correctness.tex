\section{Correctness of the Algorithm}
\textsc{Theorem 1.} \textit{For any given deterministic context-free grammar and any given nondeterministic
finite automaton with single start and single final state and with no $\epsilon$-transitions,
the algorithm terminates.}

\textsc{Proof.}
Each vertex of inner representation of the input finite automaton contains, at most, 
$N$ GSS vertices, where $N$ is a number of parser states, so for inner graph containing $n$
vertices, the number of GSS vertices is, at most, $Nn$. GSS has no multiple edges:
an edge $(v_{1}, v_{2})$ is only created if no edge exists between $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$,  
meaning, the number of edges is limited with $(Nn) \cdot (Nn - 1) / 2 $. 

The algorithm dequeues vertex to be processed from the queue $Q$ at each iteration of the 
main loop. Vertices are enqueued to $Q$ only if new edge is added to GSS. As a number of 
GSS edges is finite, the algorithm always terminates.
