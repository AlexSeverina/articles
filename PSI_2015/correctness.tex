\section{Correctness of the Algorithm}
\textsc{Theorem 1.}
\textit{For any given deterministic context-free grammar and any given nondeterministic
finite automaton with single start and single final state and with no $\epsilon$-transitions,
the algorithm terminates.}

\textsc{Proof.}
Each vertex of inner representation of the input finite automaton contains, at most, 
$N$ GSS vertices, where $N$ is a number of parser states, so for the inner graph which contains $n$
vertices, the number of GSS vertices is, at most, $Nn$. GSS has no multiple edges:
an edge $(v_{1}, v_{2})$ is only created if no edge exists between $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$,  
meaning, the number of edges is limited with $(Nn) \cdot (Nn - 1) / 2 $. 

The algorithm dequeues vertex to be processed from the queue $Q$ at each iteration of the 
main loop. Vertices are enqueued to $Q$ only if new edge is added to GSS. As a number of 
GSS edges is finite, the algorithm always terminates.

\textsc{Definition.} 
\emph{Correct tree} is an ordered, rooted tree with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The root is the start nonterminal of the grammar $G$
  \item The leaf nodes are the terminals of $G$. The sequence of the leaf nodes 
        corresponds to a path in the inner graph. 
  \item The interior nodes are the nonterminals of $G$. The children of nonterminal 
        $N$ correspond to the symbols on the righthand side of some production for $N$ in $G$.
\end{enumerate}

~\\
\textsc{Lemma 1.}
For every GSS edge $(v_{t}, v_{h})$, $v_{t} \in V_{t}.processed$, $v_{h} \in V_{h}.processed$, 
the terminals of the associated subtree corresponds to some path in the inner graph $p$ from $V_{h}$ to $V_{t}$

\textsc{Proof.}
The proof is by induction on the height of derivation tree. 
A tree of 0-height may be either an $\epsilon$-tree or a tree of a single leaf.
An $\epsilon$-tree corresponds to a path of 0-lenght, the tail and the head of the edge associated with 
$\epsilon$-tree are identical, thus the statement is true. A tree of a single leaf corresponds to a single 
terminal read from an edge ($V_{h}$, $V_{t}$) of the inner graph, thus the statement is true.

A tree which has height $k$ has a nonterminal $N$ as a root. By third item in the definition of correct tree, 
there is a production $N \rightarrow A_{0}, A_{1} \dots A_{n}$ for children of the root $A_{0}, A_{1} \dots A_{n}$. 
Subtree $A_{i}$ is associated with the GSS edge $(v_{t}^{i}, v_{h}^{i})$ and as its height is $k-1$, by induction,
there is a path in the inner graph from $V_{h}^{i}$ to $V_{t}^{i}$. As $v_{t}^i = v_{h}^{i+1}$, $V_{t}^i = V_{h}^{i+1}$, 
thus there is a path in the inner graph from $V_{h}^{0}$ to $V_{t}^{n}$ corresponding to the tree with $N$ as a root.

\textsc{Theorem 2.} 
\textit{Every tree generated from SPPF is a correct tree.}

\textsc{Proof.} Let us consider some tree generated from SPPF and proof it is coorect. 
The first and the third items of the definition are true by consequence of SPPF definition.
\textsc{Lemma 1} proofs the second item of the definition.

~\\
\textsc{Theorem 3.} 
\textit{For every path $p$ the in the inner graph, a correct tree corresponding to the $p$ could be generated from SPPF.}

\textsc{Proof.}
Consider a correct tree and show it could be generated from SPPF. The proof mimics the proof of correctness for RNGLR-algorithm,
except the following moment. RNGLR-algorithm constructs GSS layer-by-layer: it is guaranteed that
