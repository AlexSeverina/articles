\section*{Conclusion}
% The ability of partial evaluation to increase performance of GPU-based programs has been shown, particularly for string pattern matching problems. Further work is aimed at making it possible to perform partial evaluation in runtime for heterogeneous systems, and at identifying bottlenecks arising during string pattern matching partial evaluation, namely partial evaluation could diverge, i.e. not terminate, or exponentially increase the size of resulting code, which would hurt performance.

The following results have been obtained in the course of the work.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Experimental scenarios have been implemented\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Tiltedprogrammer/spec} (last accessed date: 30.05.2020)} in CUDA and AnyDSL.
    \item Experimental datasets have been gathered.
    \item The evaluation has been performed and the results have been analyzed.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GPU architecture-specific details that affect the result have been identified.
    \end{itemize}
    \item A poster with a part of this work has been published\footnote{\url{https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3332466.3374507} (last accessed date: 30.05.2020)} in the proceedings of \emph{PPOPP-2020}.
\end{itemize}

A partial evaluation has been shown to speed up memory operations in certain situations.
