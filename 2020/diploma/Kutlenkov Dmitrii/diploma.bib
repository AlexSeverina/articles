	abstract = "The 970 loop (helix 31) of Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal RNA contains two modified nucleotides, m2G966 and m5C967. Positions A964, A969, and C970 are conserved among the Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The nucleotides present at positions 965, 966, 967, 968, and 971, however, are only conserved and unique within each domain. All organisms contain a modified nucleoside at position 966, but the type of the modification is domain specific. Biochemical and structure studies have placed this loop near the P site and have shown it to be involved in the decoding process and in binding the antibiotic tetracycline. To identify the functional components of this ribosomal RNA hairpin, the eight nucleotides of the 970 loop of helix 31 were subjected to saturation mutagenesis and 107 unique functional mutants were isolated and analyzed. Nonrandom nucleotide distributions were observed at each mutated position among the functional isolates. Nucleotide identity at positions 966 and 969 significantly affects ribosome function. Ribosomes with single mutations of m2G966 or m5C967 produce more protein in vivo than do wild-type ribosomes. Overexpression of initiation factor 3 specifically restored wild-type levels of protein synthesis to the 966 and 967 mutants, suggesting that modification of these residues is important for initiation factor 3 binding and for the proper initiation of protein synthesis."

Using a novel genetic approach, all positions in the loop were simultaneously mutated and functional mutant sequences were selected in vivo. This “instant evolution” experiment revealed that approximately 190 of the 262,144 possible mutant sequences were functional. Analysis of functional mutant sequences allowed discrimination between nucleotides directly involved in protein synthesis and those involved primarily in loop structure. Among the functional mutant sequences, positions 789 and 791 were invariant and extensive covariation was observed among the nucleotides at the base of the loop at positions 787, 788, 794 and 795. NMR and thermodynamic analyses of model 790 hairpinsin vitro revealed weak pairing interactions between positions 787 and 795 and between positions 788 and 794 consistent with the in vivo mutational analysis. Functional analysis of site-directed mutants containing all possible nucleotide combinations at positions 787 and 795 in vivo showed that stable base-pairs at these positions prevent subunit association."

Recent methods for predicting RNA secondary structures cover certain classes of pseudoknotted structures, but only a few of them achieve satisfying predictions in terms of both speed and accuracy.Results: We propose IPknot, a novel computational method for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots based on maximizing expected accuracy of a predicted structure. IPknot decomposes a pseudoknotted structure into a set of pseudoknot-free substructures and approximates a base-pairing probability distribution that considers pseudoknots, leading to the capability of modeling a wide class of pseudoknots and running quite fast. In addition, we propose a heuristic algorithm for refining base-paring probabilities to improve the prediction accuracy of IPknot. The problem of maximizing expected accuracy is solved by using integer programming with threshold cut. We also extend IPknot so that it can predict the consensus secondary structure with pseudoknots when a multiple sequence alignment is given. IPknot is validated through extensive experiments on various datasets, showing that IPknot achieves better prediction accuracy and faster running time as compared with several competitive prediction methods.Availability: The program of IPknot is available at http://www.ncrna.org/software/ipknot/.

However, there is room for improvement in the objective functions presented in previous studies, which are maximized in the posterior decoding with respect to the accuracy measures for secondary structures.Results: We propose novel estimators which improve the accuracy of secondary structure prediction of RNAs. The proposed estimators maximize an objective function which is the weighted sum of the expected number of the true positives and that of the true negatives of the base pairs. The proposed estimators are also improved versions of the ones used in previous works, namely CONTRAfold for secondary structure prediction from a single RNA sequence and McCaskill-MEA for common secondary structure prediction from multiple alignments of RNA sequences. We clarify the relations between the proposed estimators and the estimators presented in previous works, and theoretically show that the previous estimators include additional unnecessary terms in the evaluation measures with respect to the accuracy. Furthermore, computational experiments confirm the theoretical analysis by indicating improvement in the empirical accuracy. The proposed estimators represent extensions of the centroid estimators proposed in Ding et al. and Carvalho and Lawrence, and are applicable to a wide variety of problems in bioinformatics.Availability: Supporting information and the CentroidFold software are available online at: http://www.ncrna.org/software/centroidfold/.Contact:hamada-michiaki@aist.go.jpSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

Detailed structures of hairpin-type pseudoknots, obtained by NMR, are now emerging, but it is still not clear which structural features are responsible for the different functions in processes like translation and replication. Especially noncoding regions are rich sources of pseudoknot structures, where they occur in domains like IRES elements and tRNA-like structures. But also its role in coding regions like in ribosomal -1 frameshifting and read-through is well established, although the precise mechanism of interference with the translational mechanism remains unknown."

	abstract = "We describe the RNA folding problem and contrast it with the much more difficult protein folding problem. RNA has four similar monomer units, whereas proteins have 20 very different residues. The folding of RNA is hierarchical in that secondary structure is much more stable than tertiary folding. In RNA the two levels of folding (secondary and tertiary) can be experimentally separated by the presence or absence of Mg2+. Secondary structure can be predicted successfully from experimental thermodynamic data on secondary structure elements: helices, loops, and bulges. Tertiary interactions can then be added without much distortion of the secondary structure. These observations suggest a folding algorithm to predict the structure of an RNA from its sequence. However, to solve the RNA folding problem one needs thermodynamic data on tertiary structure interactions, and identification and characterization of metal-ion binding sites. These data, together with force versus extension measurements on single RNA molecules, should provide the information necessary to test and refine the proposed algorithm."

	abstract = {Motivation RNA is a biopolymer with various applications inside the cell and in biotechnology. Structure of an RNA molecule mainly determines its function and is essential to guide nanostructure design. Since experimental structure determination is time-consuming and expensive, accurate computational prediction of RNA structure is of great importance. Prediction of RNA secondary structure is relatively simpler than its tertiary structure and provides information about its tertiary structure, therefore, RNA secondary structure prediction has received attention in the past decades. Numerous methods with different folding approaches have been developed for RNA secondary structure prediction. While methods for prediction of RNA pseudoknot-free structure (structures with no crossing base pairs) have greatly improved in terms of their accuracy, methods for prediction of RNA pseudoknotted secondary structure (structures with crossing base pairs) still have room for improvement. A long-standing question for improving the prediction accuracy of RNA pseudoknotted secondary structure is whether to focus on the prediction algorithm or the underlying energy model, as there is a trade-off on computational cost of the prediction algorithm versus the generality of the method.   Results The aim of this work is to argue when comparing different methods for RNA pseudoknotted structure prediction, the combination of algorithm and energy model should be considered and a method should not be considered superior or inferior to others if they do not use the same scoring model. We demonstrate that while the folding approach is important in structure prediction, it is not the only important factor in prediction accuracy of a given method as the underlying energy model is also as of great value. Therefore we encourage researchers to pay particular attention in comparing methods with different energy models.},
