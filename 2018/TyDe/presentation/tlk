Hi, my name is Semyon and i want to talk about !!!
I want to note that this work is at earley !!!
Does anybody use GPU for computations? Not for gaming)
GPGPU for computations, SIMD, etc

For GPU programming we should use low-level languages based on C, such as CUDA C or OpenCL C. But 
when we think about application we usually want to use one of high-level anguges for one of 
platforms. For example, JVM or .NET.
And interaction is a big problem.
