\section{Problem statement}
The purpose of this work is to develop an effective matrix-based algorithm for path querying with context-free and conjunctive grammars, for which it is required to solve the problems listed below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduce a matrix-based algorithm for context-free path query evaluation w.r.t. relational query semantics.
	\item Introduce a matrix-based algorithm for context-free path query evaluation w.r.t. single-path query semantics.
	\item Introduce a matrix-based algorithm for path query evaluation w.r.t.
	conjunctive grammars and relational query semantics.
	\item Show the practical applicability of our algorithms by presenting the results of their evaluation on a set of conventional benchmarks.
\end{itemize}
