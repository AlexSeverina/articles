\section{Future work}

The future work will include the platform and plugin improvement. At the platform level the available functionality for embedded code processing will be extended. Particularly we plan to implement the mechanisms that will make string-embedded code transformations possible. Code transformations can be used to perform migration from one particular DBMS to another~\cite{Migration:ref} or to new embedding technology such as LINQ. This task is related to two problems: possibility of non-trivial transformations and proof of transformations correctness. Also we plan to implement type checking. For SQL it may be both a type checking inside the dynamically constructed queries and the consistency of the returned and expected types. In the later case we should check whether the type of the query result equals to the type of the variable in the host language the result is assigned to.

Performing semantic actions over SPPF is another important direction of the research. It is needed for refactoring, translation quality improvement, automation of the transition to a more reliable meta-programming tools.
