Hello, my name is Ekaterina. I am a graduate student of Saint Petersburg State University and a researcher in JetBrains Programming languages and tools library. 
Today I want to talk about syntactic analysis of string-embedded languages. 

==1==
First of all, let me recall what is string embedding. 
By string embedding we mean simply that the strings are used in order to compose some queries to subsystems which does not "understand" the programming language of the host programm.
The most common example of this technique is embedded SQL: SQL statements are composed inside the program written in some general purpose language. 
After such statement is composed, some dedicated environment interprets it.
Another example, which is a special case of the previous one, is a dynamic SQL.
