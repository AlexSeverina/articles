\section{Introduction}%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Static program analysis usually performed over structural representation of code and parsing is a classical way to get such representation.
Parser generators often used for parser creation automation: these tools allow to create parser from grammar of language which should be specified in appropriate format.
It allows to decrease efforts required for syntax analyzer creation and maintenance.

Extended BNF (EBNF) is a useful format of grammar specification. 
Expressive and compact description of language syntax. 
This formalism often used in documentation --- one of main source of information for parsers developers.

There are a wide range of parsing techniques and algorithms: CYK, LR(k), LALR(k), LL, etc. 
One of he most popular area is generalized parsing: technique which allows to handle ambiguous grammars. 
It is possible to simplify language description required for parser generation in case a parser generator is based on generalized algorithm.
LL family is more intuitive than LR, can provide better diagnostics, but LL(1) is not enough to process some languages: there are LR, but not LL languages.
Moreover, left and hidden left recursion in grammars is a problem. 
In order to solve these problems generalized LL (GLL) was proposed~\cite{scott2010gll}. 
This algorithm handles arbitrary context free grammar, even unambiguous and (hidden)left-recursive.
Worst-case time and space complexity of GLL is cubic in terms of input size. 
For LL grammars it demonstrates linear time and space complexity.

The problem is that classical parsing algorithms requires BNF.
It is possible to convert from EBNF to BNF but with this conversion we loose the structure of main grammar and resulting trees are for the BNF grammars.

ELL, ELR~\cite{AttributedELL,ELRR,ECFGparsing,ELLParser,ELL,ECFG,ELALR,ELRParsing} and other can process EBNF but they do not deal with ambiguities in grammars.

Factorization for GLL was introduced~\cite{scott2016structuring} but it is not full support of EBNF.

In this work we present modified generalized LL parsing algorithm which handles grammars in EBNF without transformations.
Changes are very native for GLL nature.
Proposed modifications allow to get sufficient parsing performance improvement.

This article is structured as follows.
We start from .... Extended BNF

\section{EBNF processing}

EBNF definition%а какой у него дефинишон?

Extended Backus-Naur Form~\cite{iso} is a syntax of expressing context-free grammars. In addition to the Backus-Naur Form syntax it 
uses such constructions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item alternation $\mid$
    \item option [ ... ]
    \item repetition \{ ... \}
    \item grouping ( ... )
\end{itemize}
It is also common to use Extended CFG form. It operates under similar constructions so EBNF can be represented in ECFG form.
In this article we will use the notation of ECFG.

An \textit{extended context-free grammar} (ECFG) is a tuple ($N$, $\Sigma$, $P$, $S$), where $N$
and $\Sigma$ are finite sets of nonterminals and terminals, $ S\in N$ is the start symbol,
and $P$ (the productions) is a map from $N$ to regular expressions over alphabet $N \cup \Sigma$.

Regular expression syntax? Look at ``Towards a Taxonomy for ECFG and RRPG Parsing''

There are works about parsing of subsets of ECFG --- ELL(k) and ELR(k) but they do not deal with ambiguity.
``Towards a Taxonomy for ECFG and RRPG Parsing'' considers known parsing techniques for ECFG and RRPG grammars. 
But the only opportunity to parse arbitrary ECFG is Early-style parsers when very little literature can be found about this methods.

\section{Generalized LL Parsing}%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic GLL algorithm~\cite{scott2010gll} allows to perform syntax analysis of linear input by any context-free 
grammar. As a result we get Shared Packed Parse Forest(SPPF)~\cite{SPPF} that represents all possible derivations of input string.

Work of the GLL algorithm based on descriptors. Descriptor is a four-element tuple that can uniquely define state 
of parsing process. It consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Slot} --- position in grammar
    \item \textbf{Position} in input
    \item Already built \textbf{tree root}
    \item Current \textbf{GSS node}
\end{itemize}

and so on about GLL

Code in appendix or in original article

\subsection{Factorization}%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to improve performance Elizabeth Scott and Adrian Johnstone offered support of factorised grammars in GLL~\cite{scott2016structuring}. 

Description of idea.

But this idea can be extended to full EBNF support without any grammar transformations.
Let us show how to do it!!!


\section{Extended BNF GLL Parsing}%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section we will show an application of Extended Backus-Naur Form(EBNF) grammars in automatons and corresponding GLL-style parsers.

GLL allows analysis only by grammars in Backus-Naur Form. When use of EBNF is more common.

Main algorithm creates and queues new descriptors depending on current parse state that we get from unqueued descriptor. 
In case descriptor was already created it does not add it to queue. For this purpose we have a set of
\textbf{all} created descriptors. Thus reducing a number of possible descriptors decreases the parse time
and required memory.

Let us spot on \textbf{slots}. Grammar written in EBNF is usually more compact then it's representation in BNF. That means EBNF contains 
less slots and parser creates less descriptors. Thus support of EBNF in GLL can increase parsing performance. 


\subsection{Grammar Transformation}%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some basic methods converting regular expressions to nondeterministic finite state automatons. 
At the same time context-free grammar productions are regular expressions, that can contain as terminals 
as nonterminals. Thus for each grammar rule we can build a finite state automaton, with edges tagged with 
terminals, nonterminals or $\varepsilon$-symbols. We used Thompson's method~\cite{Thompson:1968:PTR:363347.363387}. 
In built automatons nonterminals should be replaced with links to initial states of automaton that stands 
for this nonterminal. An example of constructed automaton for grammar $\Gamma_{0}$\ref{fig:grammarG0} is given on fig.

Produced $\varepsilon$-NFAs can be converted to DFAs. An algorithm is described in~\cite{aho1974design}.

Minimization of the quantity of the DFA states decreases number of GLL descriptors. John Hopcroft's 
algorithm~\cite{hopcroft1971n} can be used for it. But we can apply it to all automatons at one time. 
An algorithm is based on dividing all states on equivalent classes. Initial state of algorithm consist 
of 2 classes: first contains final states and second contains all other. For our problem we can set an 
initial state as follow: first class contains all final states of \textbf{all} automatons and second class 
contains all the other. As an algorithm result we get classes which represent states of minimised DFA and 
transitions between them.
Initial state is class that contains initial state of automaton that represents productions of start nonterminal.
% Надо сказать про то что на самом деле структура грамматики не меняется. Меняется лишь её представление.

Some states have labels: names of nonterminals which productions start in that states.


\subsection{Input processing}%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Slots becomes DFA states. And just as we can move through grammar slots we can move through states 
in DFA. But in DFA we have multiple ways to go because many nonterminals can start with current input symbol. 
%So we need to prevent creation of descriptors for each nonterminal on outgoing edges. We can generate tables that 
%tells us what nonterminals can infer strings that starts with current terminal. And add descriptors only for 
%this edges. Moreover we need to create descriptor for edge that marked with current terminal if such exists.


\input{add.tex}
\input{create.tex}

\input{pop.tex}


\subsection{SPPF construction}

First, we should define derivation trees for DFA's: it is an ordered tree whose root is lable of the start state,
leaf nodes are labeled with a terminals from DFA's edges or $\varepsilon$ and interior nodes are labeled with 
nonterminals from DFA's edges($ A $) and have a sequence of children that corresponds to edge labels of path in 
DFA that starts from the state labeled $ A $. More formal. 

\begin{mydef}

Derivation tree of sentence $\alpha$ in the grammar $G=(\Sigma, N, S, P)$:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ordered rooted tree. Root labeled with $S$
\item Leafs are terminals $\in \Sigma$
\item Nodes is nonterminals
\item Node with label $N_i$ has childs $l_0, \dots\, l_n$ if and only if for $\omega = l_0 \cdot l_1 \dots\ l_n\in (\Sigma \cup N)^*$ exists $p \rightarrow M \in P$ such that $\omega \in L(M)$
\end{itemize}

\end{mydef}

DFA is ambiguous if there exist string that have more than one derivation trees. Thus, we can define SPPF for DFA. 
It is similar to SPPF for grammars described in~\cite{scott2013gll}. SPPF contains symbol nodes(like derivation trees), packed nodes
and intermediate nodes. 

Packed nodes are of the form $(S, k)$, where $S$ is a state of DFA. 
Symbol nodes have labels $(X, i, j)$ where $X$ is an edge symbol or a nonterminal. 
Intermediate nodes have labels $ (S, i, j) $, where $S$ is a state of DFA

A packed node has one or two children: right child can be symbol node, left child can be symbol or intermediate node.   
Nonterminal symbol nodes have packed children nodes of the form $(S, k)$ where $S$ is pop state. 
Terminal symbol nodes are leafs.

Use of intermediate and packed nodes leads to binarization of SPPF and thus the space complexity is $O(n^{3})$.
%But in grammars slot defines position,
%previous and next symbol, when DFA state tells the position only. Thus we can can construct SPPF using 
%In general, we can't uniquely correspond an original grammar slot to automaton state.
%We can consider example. For the grammar \ref{fig:grammarG0}, automaton will be represented as showed on fig.\ref{fig:automatonForG0}.
%SPPF for input "aa" is on fig.\ref{fig:SPPF}.

State 1 can be matched with two grammar slots: $S ::= (a \cdot a)|(b$ $a)$ and $S ::= (a$ $a)|(b \cdot a)$. 
But SPPF represents WHAT???




\textbf{function} getNodeT$(x,i)$ does not change

In states of parsing we can have a nondeterministic choice because the states of DFA can be ``pop'' states and outgoing edges can contain nonterminals.
If there exist outgoing edge that contains current terminal we need to create intermediate node.
But if the next state is ``pop'' state we also need to create nonterminal node and call \textbf{pop} function.

We defined function \textbf{getNodes} which can construct two nodes: intermediate and nonterminal (at least one of them, at most both).
It uses modified function \textbf{getNodeP} that takes additional argument: state or nonterminal name. Symbol in returned SPPF node will be this argument's value.
\input{getNodes.tex}
\input{getNodeP.tex}

Moreover we need to call \textbf{create} function for edges that contains nonterminal.
To handle nondeterminism \textbf{parse} function queues new descriptors for edge that contain current nonterminal.

Parsing function unqueues descriptors and process them untill the queue become empty.
It calls function \textbf{create} for edges that contains nonterminal.
If an edge contains current terminal it is necessary to create new terminal node and if current node is not dummy or it is not nonterminal node that derives epsilon . But if the next state

Table~\ref{expTable} shows that in general minimized version works $19\%$ faster, uses $27\%$ less descriptors and $33\%$ less GSS edges.
Also we use this FSA approach in metagenomic assemblies parsing and it gives us visible performance increase. Furthermore we can use EBNF constructions without any conversion.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Described allgorithm implemented in F\# as part of the YaccConstructor project.
Source code available here:\url{!!!}.

Proposed modification can not only increase performance, but also decrease memory usage. 
It is critical for big input processing.
For example, Anastasia Ragozina in her master's thesis~\cite{!!!} shows that GLL can be used for graph parsing.  
In some areas graphs can be really huge: assemblies in bioinfomatics ($10^8$...).
Proposed modification can improve performance not only in case of classical parsing, but in graph parsing too. 
We perform some tests that shows performance increasing in metagenomic analysis, but full integration with graph parsing and formal description is required.

One of way to specify any useful manipulations on derivation tree (or semantic of language) is an attributed grammars~\cite{!!!}.
YARD supports it but our algorithm is not.
So, attributed grammar and semantic calculation is a future work.
