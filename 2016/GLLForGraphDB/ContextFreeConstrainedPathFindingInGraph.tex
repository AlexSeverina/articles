\section{Introduction}
Graph data model and graph data bases are very popular in many different areas such as bioinformatic, semantic web, social networks etc.
Extraction of paths satisfying specific constraints may be useful for graph structured data investigation and for relations between data items detection.
Path querying with constrains formulated in terms of formal grammars is a specific problem named formal language constrained path problem~\cite{FLCpathProblem} and research in this area is still actual~\cite{DirOfBigGraphAnalysis}.

Classical parsing techniques can be used to solve formal language constrained path problem thus we can use ``graph parsing'' and it may be required not only in graph data base quering but also in other 
different areas: formal verification, and string-embedded language processing, for example. 

The moste solution in DB area use such parsing algorithms as CYK or Earley.
In string-embedded languages analysis (RN)GLR is used.
It has better time complexity.

Complexity is $O(n^3)$ in worst case and linear for unambiguous grammars, that better than complexity of CYK and Earley which used as base in other solutions (for example~\cite{ConjCFPathQuery}, ~\cite{GraphQueryWithEarley}).
This fact allow to demonstarte better performance on linear subgraphs and unambiguous grammars.
Also it is not necessary to transform input grammar to CNF which required for CYK which allow to avoid grmmar size decreasing.
It is important because real performance of parsing algorithm is sensetive to grammar size.


Graph parsing can be also used in string-embedde languages prcessing. 
Regular approximation for value set of string variable can by represened as directed graph of related fite automata.
In orded to check corectness or safety (sql injections)... all generated strings (all paths from start states to final states) are correct w.r.t some context-free grammar.
For example grammar of one of SQL dialects.
GLR-based for string-embedded SQL checking~\cite{Alvor1, Alvor2}.
Solution based on RNGLR~\cite{rnglr} for relaxed parsing of string-embedded languages~\cite{relaxedRNGLR} which allow to find all path between two specified vertices.

Despite of the fact that there is set of path quering solutions~\cite{GraphQueryWithEarley, ConjCFPathQuery, !!!}, query result exploration still a challenge~\cite{hofman2015separabilityForRegQueryDebugging}. 
Complex query debugging also is a problem. 
To solve these problems structural represenatation of query result can be useful, and classical parsing thechniques allow to construct such representation: derivation tree contains full information abaut parsed sentence structure in terms of specified grammar.


In this paper, we propose graph parsing technique which allow to construct structural representation of query result with reletion to grammar query or derivation of result.

So, we propose algorithm based top-down parsing algorithm. LL is more natural and so on.

\section{Algorithm For Graph Parsing}
We propose a context-free language constrained path problem solution which allow to find all paths satisfied specified arbitrary context-free grammar and to construct implicit representation of result. 
Finite representation of result set with structure related to specified grammar may be useful not only for results understanding and processing but also for query debugging especially for complex queries. 

Our solution is based on generalized LL (GLL)~\cite{scott2010gll, FastPracticalGLL} parsing algorithm which allow to process ambiguous context-free grammars.
%Complexity is $O(n^3)$ in worst case and linear for unambiguous grammars, that better than complexity of CYK and Earley which used as base in other solutions (for example~\cite{ConjCFPathQuery}, ~\cite{GraphQueryWithEarley}).
%This fact allow to demonstarte better performance on linear subgraphs and unambiguous grammars.
%Also it is not necessary to transform input grammar to CNF which required for CYK which allow to avoid grmmar size decreasing.
%It is important because real performance of parsing algorithm is sensetive to grammar size.


\subsection{Generalized LL Parsing Algorithm}

Generalized LL (GLL) is generalized top-down parsing algorithm which handle all context-free grammars (including left recursive) with worst-case cubic time complexity and linear for LL grammars.
GLL is native for grammar, can be simple created blah-blah-blah.

GLL use descriptors for parsing states specification.
Each descriptor contains full specification of process state anought to start parsing from state stored.

Descriptor is a quadriple $(L, s, j, a)$ where $L$ is a line label, $s$ is a stack, $j$ is a position in the input, and $a$ is a node of derivation tree.

allows to restore parsing

Graph structured stack (GSS)~\cite{Tomita} for multiple stack combining to prevent duplication.
In GLL each GSS node is pair of position in input and grammmar slot. Grammar slot is a !!! 

\subsection{Shared packed parse forest}

Shared Packed Parse Forest (SPPF)~\cite{SPPF} is a spetial data structure for derivation forest compact representation which allow to reuse common nodes and subtrees.
As a result multiple derivation trees, which can be produced in case of ambiguos grammar, can be compressed in one SPPF with optimal reusing of common parts.  
Binarized form of SPPF proposed in~\cite{brnglr} and it allow to achive worst-case cubic space complexity.
GLL can use SPPF~\cite{gllParsingTree} for results representation achive cubic space complexity with binarised version.

Let we present an example of SPPF for ambiguos grammar $G_0$ (pic~\ref{grammarG0}).

\begin{figure}[h]
   \begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
   0: s = NUM
   1: s = LBR s RBR
   2: s = s s
\end{verbatim}
   \caption{Grammar $G_0$}
   \label{grammarG0}        
   \end{center}
\end{figure}

Here \verb|N| is token for number, \verb|L| and \verb|R| are tokens for '(' and ')'  respectively.

Let we parse the sentence \verb|"()()()"|. 
There are two diferent lefmost derivations of this sentence in grammar $G_0$ ($\rightarrow ^ n$ denote an application of production with nimber $n$): 
\begin{enumerate} 
    \item $s \rightarrow ^ 2 s s \rightarrow ^ 2 s s s \rightarrow ^ 1 L s R s s \rightarrow ^ 0 L N R s s \rightarrow ^ 1 
    L N R L s R s \rightarrow ^ 1 L N R L s R s \rightarrow ^ 0 L N R L N R s \rightarrow ^ 1 L N R L N R L s R \rightarrow ^ 0 L N R L N R L N R$
    \item $s \rightarrow ^ 2 s s \rightarrow ^ 1 L s R s  \rightarrow ^ 0 L N R s \rightarrow ^ 2 L N R s s  \rightarrow ^ 1 
    L N R L s R s \rightarrow ^ 1 L N R L s R s \rightarrow ^ 0 L N R L N R s \rightarrow ^ 1 L N R L N R L s R \rightarrow ^ 0 L N R L N R L N R$
\end{enumerate}
 
    As far as there are tho different derivations, SPPF should contains two different trees and it is presented in figure~\ref{sppfSample}: result SPPF(fig. ~\ref{sppf}) and trees for derivation 1(fig.~\ref{tree1}) and derivation 2(fig.~\ref{tree2}) respectively.

    \label{sppfSample}
    \end{center}                
\end{figure*}

Binarised SPPF can be represented as a graph where each node has one of four types: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item terminal node with label $(i,T,j)$;
    \item nonterminal node with label $(i,N,j)$;
    \item intermidiate node with label $(t,i,j)$ where $t$ is a grammar slot;
    \item packed node with label $(N : \gamma \cdot, k)$;
\end{itemize}
, and one of nodes can be marked as 'root' --- node for start nonterminal.

Further in our examples we will remove redudant intermidiate and packed nodes from SPPF to simplify it and decrease size of structure.

\subsection{GLL-based graph parsing}

In order to adapt GLL for graph parsing we need only use graph verticea as position in input.
As far as we work with context-free languages it is not important how this descriptor was created, and so descriptors management and other basic mechanisms of original algorithm can be reused ``as is''. 
We can merge it if they are equal. 

We implement some optimizations:~\cite{FastPracticalGLL}

We also use binarised SPPF for result representation whish allow to simplify query debugging and result explortion.
In our case more then one root may be specified. For example, look at picture!!!! 
We 

$\mathbb{P}:G, M, StartVset, FinalVSet \rightarrow SPPF$
In details, main function input is graph $M$, set of start vertices $V_s\subseteq V$, set of final vertices $V_f\subseteq V$, grammar $G_1$.
Output is Shared Packed Parse Forest (SPPF)~\cite{SPPF} --- finite data structure which contains all derivation trees for all paths in $M$, $\Omega(p) \in L(G_1)$ and allows to reconstruct any of paths implicitly.
As far as we can specify sets of start and final vertices, our solution can find all paths in graph, all paths from specified vertex, all paths between specified vertices. 
Also SPPF represents a structure of paths in terms of derivation which allow to get more useful 
information about result. 
Binarized SPPF is at most cubic in terms of result size. 
Any path can be extracted in the linear time.
