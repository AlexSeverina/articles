\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We propose GLL-based algorithm for context-free path querying which construct finite structural representation of all paths satisfying given constraint.
Provided data structure can be useful for result investigation and processing, and for query debugging.
Presented algorithm has been implemented in F\#~\cite{FSharp} and is available on GitHub:\url{https://github.com/YaccConstructor/YaccConstructor}.

In order to estimate practical value of proposed algorithm we should perform evaluation on a real dataset and real queries.
One possible application of our algorithm is metagenomical assembly querying, and we are currently working on this topic.

We are also working on performance improvement by implementation of recently proposed modifications in original GLL algorithm~\cite{FGLL,FastPracticalGLL}.
One direction of our research is generalization of grammar factorization proposed in~\cite{FGLL} which may be useful for the processing of regular queries which are common in real world application.

%We are working on utilization of GPGPU and multicore CPU power for graph parsing problem with Valiant~\cite{valiantParsingWithMatrixMultiplication} algorithm modification proposed by Alexander Okhotin~\cite{okhotin2014parsingWithMatrixMultiplication}.
%One of possible benefit is ability to process more expressive queries because modification proposed by Alexander Okhotin extended to support boolean grammars.
