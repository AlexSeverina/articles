\section{Introduction}
Graph data model and graph data bases are very popular in many different areas such as bioinformatics, semantic web, social networks, etc.
Extraction of paths which satisfy specific constraints may be useful for investigation of graph structured data and for detection of relations between data items.
One specific problem---path querying with constraints---is usually formulated in terms of formal grammars and is called formal language constrained path problem~\cite{FLCpathProblem}.

%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
%Information from different areas such as bioinformatic, semantic web, social networks can be represented in graph model. 
%Moreover, there are data graph data bases. (?) One of the common graph problem is paths extraction from graph. 
%Paths must satisfy specific constrains and the search must use a reasonable time. (?)     
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Classical parsing techniques can be used to solve formal language constrained path problem. 
It means that such technique can be used for more common problem---``graph parsing''. 
Graph parsing may be required in graph data base querying, formal verification, string-embedded language processing and another areas where graph structured data is used. 

Existing solutions in databases field usually use such parsing algorithms as CYK or Earley(for example~\cite{ConjCFPathQuery}, ~\cite{GraphQueryWithEarley}). 
These algorithms have nonlinear time complexity for unambiguous grammars ($O(n^3)$ and $O(n^2)$ respectively).
Moreover the input grammar should be transformed to Chomsky normal form (CNF) in case of CYK which leads to grammar size increasing and .
To solve these problems we can use such parsing algorithms as GLR and GLL which have cubic worst-case complexity and linear for unambiguous grammars.
Also there is no need to transfor grammar to CNF for these algorithms.
These facts allow us to improve performance of parsing in some cases.

Despite the fact that there is a set of path querying solutions~\cite{GraphQueryWithEarley, ConjCFPathQuery, !!!}, query result exploration is still a challenge~\cite{hofman2015separabilityForRegQueryDebugging}. 
Simplification of complex query debugging is also a problem.
Structural representation of query result can be used to solve these problems, and classical parsing techniques provide such representation---derivation tree---which contains exhaustive information about parsed sentence structure in terms of specified grammar.

Graph parsing can also be used to analyze dynamically generated strings or string-embedded languages. 
String variable in a program may gets more then one value in run time.
For static analysis we can use regular approximation for value set of string variable which can be represented as a finite automaton.
Moreover, if we want to check a syntactic correctness of dynamically generated strings, we should check that all generated strings (all paths from start states to final states in the given automaton) are correct with respect to given context-free grammar. 
There are some solutions to this problem: GLR-based checker of string-embedded SQL queries~\cite{Alvor1, Alvor2};
 parser of string-embedded languages~\cite{relaxedRNGLR} based on RNGLR parsing algorithm.
RNGLR-based algorithm allows to construct derivation forest for all correct paths in the input automaton.

In this paper we propose graph parsing technique which allows to construct structural representation of query result with respect to given grammar.
This structure can be useful for query debugging and exploration. 
Proposed algorithm is based on generalized top-down parsing algorithm---GLL~\cite{scott2010gll}---which has cubic worst-case time complexity and linear for LL grammars on linear input.
