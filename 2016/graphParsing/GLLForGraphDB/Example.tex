\subsection{Example}

Let we introduce the next example. Grammar $G_1$ is a query and we want to find all paths in graph $M$ (presented in picture~\ref{input}) matched this query.
Result SPPF for this input is presented in picture~\ref{SPPF}. Note that presented version does not contein obsolete nodes.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{dot/AnBn.pdf}
        \caption{Result SPPF for input graph $M$(pic.~\ref{input}) and query $G_1$(pic.~\ref{grammarG})}
        \label{SPPF}        
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

We use next markers for nodes which similar to original SPPF but have some additional information in order to relation with graph.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Node with rectangle shape labeled with $(v_0, T, v_1)$ is terminal node. 
    Each terminal node corresponds with edge in the input graph: for each node with label $(v_0, T, v_1)$ there is $e\in E: e=(v_0,T,v_1)$.
    Duplication of terminal nodes is only for figure simplification.
    \item Node with oval shape labeled with $(v_0, nt, v_1)$ is nonterminal node. 
    This node denote that there is at least one path $p$ from vertex $v_0$ to vertex $v_1$ in input graph $M$ such that $nt \Rightarrow^*_G \Omega(p)$.
    All paths matched this condition can be extracted from SPPF by left-to-right top-down graph traversal started from respective node. 
    \item Filled node with oval shape labeled with $(<\mkern-11mu | \mkern-11mu> (v_0, nt, v_1))$ is nonterminal node denote that there are more then one path $p$ from $v_0$ to $v_1$ such that $nt \Rightarrow^*_G \Omega(p)$.
    \item Node with dot shape is used for representation of derivation variants.
    Subgraph with root in one such node is one variant of derivation.
    Parent of such nodes is always node with label $(<\mkern-9mu | \mkern-9mu> (v_0, nt, v_1))$.
    \item $v_0$ and $v_1$ are left and right extensions of node respectively.
\end{itemize}

As an example of derivation structure usage we can find 'middle' of any path in example above simply by finding corresponded nonterminal $middle$ in SPPF.
So we can found that there is only one common ancestor for all results, and it is vertex with $id = 0$. 

Extensions stored in nodes allow to check whether path from $u$ to $v$ exists, and extract it. 
To extract specified path we need only travers SPPF, and it can be done in linear time (in terms of SPPF size). 

Let for example we want to find paths satisfying specified in $G_1$ constraints from vertex $0$.
To do this we should find vertices with label $(0, s, \_)$ in SPPF.
We can see that there are two vertices with reqired label: $(0, s, 0)$ and $(0, s, 3)$.
Next step let we try to extract corresponded paths from SPPF.
In our example there is cycle in SPPF so there are \textbf{at least} two different paths: $$p_0=\{(0,A,1);(1,A,2);(2,A,0);(0,B,3);(3,B,0);(0,B,3)\}$$ and 
\begin{align*}
p_1=\{&(0,A,1);(1,A,2);(2,A,0);(0,A,1);(1,A,2);(2,A,0);\\ &(0,B,3);(3,B,0);(0,B,3);(3,B,0);(0,B,3);(3,B,0)\}.
\end{align*}


Thus SPPF which constructed by described algorithm can be useful for query result investigation. 
But in some cases explicit representation of matched subgraph may be preferred, and requred subgraph may be extracted from SPPF trivially by its traversal.
