abstract="The context-free language (CFL) reachability problem is well known and studied in computer science, as a fundamental problem underlying many important static analyses such as points-to-analysis. Solving the CFL reachability problem in the general case is very hard. Popular solutions resorting to a graph traversal exhibit a time complexity of O(k3n3) for a grammar of size k. For Dyck CFLs, a particular class of CFLs, this complexity can be reduced to O(kn3). Only recently the first subcubic algorithm was proposed by Chaudhuri, dividing the complexity of predating solutions by a factor of logn.",

abstract = "A new generalization of context-free grammars is introduced: Boolean grammars allow the use of all set-theoretic operations as an integral part of the formalism of rules. Rigorous semantics for these grammars is defined by language equations in a way that allows to generalize some techniques from the theory of context-free grammars, including Chomsky normal form, Cocke–Kasami–Younger cubic-time recognition algorithm and some limited extension of the notion of a parse tree, which together allow to conjecture practical applicability of the new concept."

The algorithm reduces construction of a parsing table to computing multiple products of Boolean matrices of various sizes. Its time complexity on an input string of length n is O(BMM(n)logn), where BMM(n) is the number of operations needed to multiply two Boolean matrices of size n×n, which is O(nω) with ω<2.373 as per the current knowledge. A parse tree can be constructed in time MM(n)logO(1)n (where MM(n) is the complexity of multiplying two integer matrices), by applying a known efficient procedure for determining witnesses for Boolean matrix multiplication. The algorithm has a succinct proof of correctness and is ready to be implemented."

The first result states that cfl's can be recognized on a cube-connected computer (CCC) or on a perfect-shuffle computer (PSC) in log2n time using n6 processors. There are known algorithms with the same parallel time complexity but they use more powerful models of computation. The second result states that deterministic cfl's can be recognized in polynomial time using one log2n bounded pushdown store and log n tape. Known algorithms use log2n tape. Since algorithm is a simulation of a deterministic pda it may be looked upon as an efficient reduction of the height of the pushdown store. The second result is obtained by applying a transformation of a fast parallel recognition of deterministic cfl's and it can be viewed as an application of parallel algorithms to the design of efficient sequential algorithms.",

abstract = "A recognition algorithm is exhibited whereby an arbitrary string over a given vocabulary can be tested for containment in a given context-free language. A special merit of this algorithm is that it is completed in a number of steps proportional to the “cube” of the number of symbols in the tested string. As a byproduct of the grammatical analysis, required by the recognition algorithm, one can obtain, by some additional processing not exceeding the “cube” factor of computational complexity, a parsing matrix—a complete summary of the grammatical structure of the sentence. It is also shown how, by means of a minor modification of the recognition algorithm, one can obtain an integer representing the ambiguity of the sentence, i.e., the number of distinct ways in which that sentence can be generated by the grammar. The recognition algorithm is then simulated on a Turing Machine. It is shown that this simulation likewise requires a number of steps proportional to only the “cube” of the test string length."

First, we show that alternating Turing machines are also a surprisingly good model of parallel complexity, by showing that simultaneous size/depth of uniform circuits is the same as space/time of alternating Turing machines, with depth and time within a constant factor and likewise log(size) and space. Second, we apply this to characterize NC, the class of polynomial size and polynomial-in-log depth circuits, in terms of tree-size bounded alternating TMs and other models. In particular, this enables us to show that context-free language recognition is in NC. Third, we investigate various definitions of uniform circuit complexity, showing that it is fairly insensitive to the choice of definition."
