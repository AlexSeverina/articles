\section{Brahma.FSharp}

In this section we present our platform for GPGPU programming in F\#.

Research project: SPbU and JetBrains Research.

Blah-Blah-Blah!!!!

\subsection{Architecture}

Based on F\# code quotation to OpenCL translator.

GPGPU driver is OpenCL.NET~\footnote{OpenCL.NET --- low level .NET bindings for OpenCL. Project site [visited: 20.06.2017]: \url{https://openclnet.codeplex.com/}.}

Picture.

Workflow:

Detailed description of some blocks are provided below.

\subsection{Translator}

Subset of F\# to openCL.
More details are available here: \url{wwww}.
Classical techniques: var scopes,

Strongly typed: exactly same signature, but logic is changed.

Structs, tuples, etc

\subsection{OpenCL specific operations}

Atomic functions.
For kernal code only.

Memory transferring.

\subsection{OpenCL type provider}

It is necessary to provide mechanism for existing kernels reusing.
OpenCL kernels destribution --- source code

Create strongly typed functions from existing OpenCL kernels code.
