\section{Introduction}

GPGPU is popular technique for....

Tools and languages are low level.
It is ood for high performance, but bad for developers.

OpenCL, CUDA etc.

Complex problems, geterogenious platforms: multicore, multi GPGPU etc.
Special tools, libs required for development simlification.
High level languages and platforms are used for application development.

F\# primitives are helpful for metaprogramming and parallel/asyncronious programming.

General reqirenments: highlevel languge, existing code/dlls/other stuff reusing

Existing solutions, auch as Alea.GPU, FCSL, are not good enough. Why?
Many different attempts for high level platform, such as JVM

Brahma.FSharp --- the best platform for GPGPU programming!!!!
Quotations to OpenCL translator with many cool features.
