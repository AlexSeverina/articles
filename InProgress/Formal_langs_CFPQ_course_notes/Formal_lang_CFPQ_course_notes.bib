abstract = "We present a method based on top-down parsing techniques for evaluating context-free path queries on RDF Graph Databases. The syntax of the query language is based on SPARQL. The language extends SPARQL by allowing the use of non-terminal symbols of a context-free grammar to specify paths on the graph. In this manner, the language subsumes the definition of regular graph patterns present in SPARQL. Our query evaluator takes an RDF graph, a context-free grammar and a declarative query, and produces tuples of values. The query evaluator proceeds in two stages: Firstly, the RDF graph is enriched with edges representing paths which correspond to strings derived by the grammar. We show that this algorithm is correct and presents a cubic worst-case run-time complexity on the number of nodes in the graph, which is an improvement over some previous work. The second stage of the evaluator uses the produced graph to identify tuples of values defined by a declarative query. In order to validate our approach, we conducted experiments by using some popular ontologies as well as synthetic databases. We compare performance results of our method with some related work."

This problem is relevant for the analysis of string-embedded languages when a host program generates clauses of embedded language at run time. Our technique is based on a generalization of RNGLR algorithm, which, inherently, allows us to construct a finite representation of parse forest for regularly approximated set of input strings. This representation can be further utilized for semantic analysis and transformations in the context of reengineering, code maintenance, program understanding etc. The approach in question implements relaxed parsing: non-recognized strings in approximation set are ignored with no error detection.",

title = "Conjunctive and boolean grammars: The true general case of the context-free grammars",
abstract = "Conjunctive grammars extend the definition of a context-free grammar by allowing a conjunction operation in the rules; Boolean grammars are further equipped with an explicit negation. These grammars maintain the main principle of the context-free grammars, that of defining syntactically correct strings inductively from their substrings, but lift the restriction of using disjunction only. This paper surveys the results on conjunctive and Boolean grammars obtained over the last decade, comparing them to the corresponding results for ordinary context-free grammars and their main subfamilies. Much attention is given to parsing algorithms, most of which are inherited from the case of ordinary context-free grammars without increasing their computational complexity. The intended readership includes any computer scientists looking for a compact and accessible description of this formal model and its properties, as well as for a general outlook on formal grammars. The paper is also addressed to theoretical computer scientists seeking a subject for research; an account of pure theoretical research in the area presented in this paper is accompanied by a list of significant open problems, with an award offered for the first correct solution of each problem. Several directions for future investigation are proposed.",

abstract="Navigational graph queries are an important class of queries that can extract implicit binary relations over the nodes of input graphs. Most of the navigational query languages used in the RDF community, e.g. property paths in W3C SPARQL 1.1 and nested regular expressions in nSPARQL, are based on the regular expressions. It is known that regular expressions have limited expressivity; for instance, some natural queries, like same generation-queries, are not expressible with regular expressions. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present cfSPARQL, an extension of SPARQL query language equipped with context-free grammars. The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than property paths and nested expressions. The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph similarities, graph summarization and ontology alignment. Despite the increasing expressivity, we show that cfSPARQL still enjoys a low computational complexity and can be evaluated efficiently.",

If every language in�{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}L{\}}{\$}is accepted by a one-way nondeterministic storage automaton, then we give an appealing characterization of the computational complexity of the labeled graph reachability problem in terms of two-way nondeterministic storage automata with auxiliary worktape that is logarithmic-space bounded. Moreover, we also consider acyclic graphs in the underlying reachability instance, obtaining a lower bound result for auxiliary storage automata that are simultaneously space and time restricted.",
