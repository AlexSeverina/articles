\section{Conclusion}

!!!! Was presented.
Evaluation demonstartes that!!!
The way to solve teoretical problem is provided.

Subcubic CFPQ in general case --- sublinear transitive closure.

On RSM optimization and query optimization. RSM minimization, ther transformations.

We evaluate na{\"i}ve implemantation. Try to use advanced algorithms for dynamic transotive closure~\cite{cs6345}.

HiCOO format~\cite{!!!} for distributed processing of huge graphs.

GPGPU-based implementation. Multi-GPU version. Unified memory, etc~\cite{!!!}

Full integration with Graph DB.
For example, with RedisGraph.
SuiteSparse as abse and success of matrix algorithm integration~\cite{!!!}

Other semantics: shortest path, simple path and so on. 
Weighted graphs.

Streaming graph querying.
Both regular~\cite{Pacaci2020RegularPQ} and context-free.

Specialization on query.
Algebraic opersations specialization (partially static data in Haskell~\cite{!!!}).
Runtime specialization (Posgres)~\cite{!!!}
