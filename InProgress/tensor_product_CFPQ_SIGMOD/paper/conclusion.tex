\section{Conclusion}

!!!! Was presented.

Subcubic CFPQ in general case --- sublinear transitive closure.

On RSM optimization and query optimization.

We evaluate na{\"i}ve implemantation. Try to use advanced dynamic algorithms~\cite{cs6345}.

HiCOO format.

GPGPU-based implementation. Multi-GPU version. 

Full integration with Graph DB.

Other semantics: shortest path, simple path and so on.

Streaming graph querying.

Specialization on query.
