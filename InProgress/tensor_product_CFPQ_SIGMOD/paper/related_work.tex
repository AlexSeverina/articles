\section{Related Work}

Language constrained path querying widely used in graph databases, static code analysis and other areas.
Both, RPQ and CFPQ (known as CFL reachability problem in static code analysis) actively studied last years.

A number of high-performance RPQ algorithms are: derivatives~\cite{10.1145/2949689.2949711}, Glushkov~\cite{Wang2019}, etc.!!!!~\cite{!!!} distributed, not linear algebra.

CFPQ algorithms: Hellings~\cite{hellingsRelational}, Bradford~\cite{8249039}, Azimov~\cite{Azimov:2018:CPQ:3210259.3210264}, Verbitskaya~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-41579-6_22}, Martin Musicante~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-91662-0_17,Medeiros:2018:EEC:3167132.3167265}, form static code analysis~\cite{!!!}, 

Subcubic CFPQ is a long-standing problem which is actively studied in both graph database and static code analysis communities. : Phillip Bradford~\cite{Bradford2017EfficientEP}, Chatterjee~\cite{10.1145/3158118}, For trees --- partial cases, RSM-s~\cite{rsm:analysis:10.1007/3-540-44585-4_18} --- 4 Russians method, Smth else?~\cite{zhang2020conditional,pavlogiannis2020finegrained}

Linear algebra for graphs, for languages. 
Linear algebra based approaches to evaluate queries (Datalog, SPARQL, etc)~\cite{10.1145/3302424.3303962,DBLP:journals/corr/MetzlerM15a} Not focused on types of queries.
