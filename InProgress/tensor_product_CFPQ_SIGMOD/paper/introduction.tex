\section{Introduction}


Language-constrained path querying. 
Regular ath querying (RPQ) is !!!!
Context-cfree is more specific, but actively developing last years.

CFPQ as a separated algorithms. Matrix is the fastest. 

To make it usable... Integration with graph DB.

Integration with query languages. 
The problem. We cannot separate regular and context-free queries in general case.  

Moreover, grammar transformation for matrix-based (the fastest existing algorithm) is required, !!!

Linear algebra, GraphBLAS, !!!! is a right way.

Subcubic CFPQ. Long-time open problem.

Contribution
\begin{enumerate}
	\item New algorithm. Based on operation over Boolena matrices. All paths semantics. Previous matrix-based solution only single path. Correctness and time complexity.
	\item Subcubic for planar graps. Conjecture on sublinear dynamic transitive closure and subcubic CFPQ. 
	\item Evaluation.
