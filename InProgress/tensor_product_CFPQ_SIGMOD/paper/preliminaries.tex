\section{Preliminaries}

In this section we introduce basic notation and definitions from graph theory and formal language theory which are used in our work.

\subsection{Language-Constrained Path Querying Problem}

We use a directed edge-labeled graph as a data model. 
To introduce \textit{Language-Constarint Path Querying Problem}~\cite{!!!} over directed edge-labeled graphs we should introduce both language and grammar definition.

First of all, we introduce edge-labelled diraph $\mathcal{G} = \langle V,E,L \rangle$, where $V$ is a finite set of vertices, $E \in V \times L \times V$ is a finite set of edges, $L$ is a finite set of edge labels. 
Note that one can always introduce bijection between $V$ and $Q = \{0, \ldots, |V|-1\}$, thus in our work we gues that $V = \{0, \ldots, |V|-1\}$.

The example of a graph which we will use in further examples is presented in figure~\ref{fig:example_input_graph}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering        
    \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,auto]
       \node[state] (q_0)                      {$0$};
       \node[state] (q_1) [above right=of q_0] {$1$};
       \node[state] (q_2) [right=of q_0]       {$2$};
       \node[state] (q_3) [right=of q_2]       {$3$};
        \path[->]
        (q_0) edge  node {a} (q_1)
        (q_1) edge  node {a} (q_2)
        (q_2) edge  node {a} (q_0)
        (q_2) edge[bend left, above]  node {b} (q_3)
        (q_3) edge[bend left, below]  node {b} (q_2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{The example of input graph $\mathcal{G}$}
    \label{fig:example_input_graph}
\end{figure}

Each edge-labeled graph can be representad as adjacency matrix $M$: square $|V|\times|V|$ matrix, such that $M[i,j] = \{l \mid e = (i,l,j) \in E\}$.
Adjacency matrix $M_2$ of the graph $\mathcal{G}$ is 

$$
    M_2 =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    . & \{a\} & . & .     \\
    . & . & \{a\} & .     \\
    \{a\} & . & . & \{b\} \\
    . & . & \{b\} & .
    \end{pmatrix}.
$$

In our work we use decomposition of the adjacency matrix to a set of Boolean matrices: 
$$
\mathcal{M} = \{M^l \mid l \in L, M^l[i,j]=1 \iff l \in M[i,j]\}.
$$

Matrix $M_2$ can be represented as a set of two Boolean matrices $M_2^a$ and $M_2^b$ where
\begin{align}
M_2^{a} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    . & 1 & . & .   \\
    . & . & 1 & .   \\
    1 & . & . & .   \\
    . & . & . & .  
\end{pmatrix}, 
M_2^{b} =
\begin{pmatrix}      
    . & . & . & .   \\
    . & . & . & .   \\
    . & . & . & 1   \\
    . & . & 1 & . 
\end{pmatrix} \label{eq:boolean_decomposition_of_graph}
\end{align}


This way we reduce operations which are necessary for our algorithm from operations over custom semiring (over edge labels) to operations over a Boolean semiring.

Also, we should define the path in the graph and word formed by the path.

\begin{definition}
Path $\pi$ in the graph $\mathcal(G) = \langle V,E,L \rangle$ is a seqence $e_0,e_1,\ldots,e_{n-1}$, where $e_i = (v_i,l_i,u_i) \in E$ and for any $e_i, e_{i+1}$ $u_i = v_{i+1}$. We denote path from $v$ to $u$ as $v\pi u$.   
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The word formed by a path $$\pi = (v_0,l_0,v_1),(v_1,l_1,v_2),\ldots,(v_{n-1},l_{n-1},v_n)$$ is a concatenation of labels along the path: $\omega(\pi) = l_0 l_1 \ldots l_{n-1}$.
\end{definition}

The next part is a definitions from formal language theory.
\begin{definition}
A language $\mathcal{L}$ over finite alphabet $\Sigma$ is a subset of all possible sequences formed by symbols from the alphabet: $\mathcal{L}_{\Sigma} = \{\omega \mid \omega \in \Sigma^*\}$.
\end{definition}

Now we are ready to introduce CFPQ problem for the given graph  $\mathcal{G} = \langle V,E,L \rangle$ and the given language $\mathcal{L}$ with reachability and all paths semantics.

\begin{definition}
To evaluate context-free path query with reachability semantics is to construct a set of pairs of vertices $(v_i,v_j)$ such that there exists a path $v_i \pi v_j$ in $\mathcal{G}$ which forms the word from the given language:
$$
R = \{(v_i,v_j) \mid \exists \pi: v_i \pi v_j, \omega(\pi) \in \mathcal{L} \}
$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
To evaluate context-free path query with all paths semantics is to construct a set of path $\pi$ in $\mathcal{G}$ which forms the word from the given language:
$$
\Pi = \{ \pi \mid \omega(\pi) \in \mathcal{L}\}
$$
\end{definition}

Note that $\Pi$ can be infinite, thus in practice, we should provide a way with reasonable complexity to enumerate such paths, instead of explicit construction of the $\Pi$.

\subsection{Regular Path Queries and Finite State Machine}

The first case of language-constrained path qurying is \textit{Regular Path Querying} (RPQ): the language $L$ is a regular language. This case is widely spread in ractice~\cite{!!!}. 

Usual way to spesify regular languages is \textit{regular expressions}. 
We use the naxt definition of regular expressions.
\begin{definition}
Regular expression (and regular language) over alphabet $\Sigma$ can be inductively defined as follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\varnothing$ (empty language) is regular expression
	\item $\varepsilon$ (empty string) is regular expression
	\item $a_i \in \Sigma$ is regular expression
	\item if $R_1$ and $R_2$ are regular expressions, then $R_1 \mid R_2$ (alternation), $R_1 \cdot R_2$ (concatenation), $R_1^*$ (Kleene star) are also regular expressions. 
\end{itemize}
\end{definition} 

For example, one can specify regular expression $R_1 = ab^*$ to find paths in the graph $\mathcal{G}$ (fig.~\ref{fig:example_input_graph}). Expected result is set of paths which start with $a$-labeled edge and contain zero o more $b$-laneled edges ather that.

In this work we use notion of \textit{Finite-State Machine} (FSM) or \textit{Finite-State Automaton} (FSA) for RPQs. 

\begin{definition}
Deterministic Finite-State Machine $T$ is a tuple $\langle \Sigma, Q, Q_s, Q_f, \delta \rangle$ where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Sigma$ is an input alphabet,
	\item $Q$ is a finite set of states,
	\item $Q_s \subseteq Q$ is a set of start (or initial) states,
	\item $Q_f \subseteq Q$ is a set of final states,
    \item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q$ is a transition function.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

It is well known, that every regular expression can be converted to to deterministic FSM without $\varepsilon$-transitions.
To do it one can use~\cite{}.
In our work we use FSM as a representation of RPQ. 
FSM can be naturally representaed by directed edge-labeled graph: $V = Q$, $L = \Sigma$, $E = \{(q_i,l,q_j) \mid \delta(q_i,l) = q_j\}$, some vertices have special markers to specify strat and final staes. Example of graph-style representattion of FSM $T_1$ for the regular expression is presented in firure~\ref{fig:example_fsm}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering        
    \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,auto]
       \node[state, initial] (q_0)                      {$0$};
       \node[state, accepting] (q_1) [right=of q_0] {$1$};
       \path[->]
        (q_0) edge  node {a} (q_1)
        (q_1) edge[loop above]  node {b} (q_1)
        ;
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{The example of graph represenation of FSM for the regular expression $ab^*$}
    \label{fig:example_fsm}
\end{figure}

As a result, FSM also can be representad as a set of Boolean ajencancy matrices $\mathcal{M}$ with additional information about start and final vertices. Such representation of $T_1$ is
$$
M^a =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&1 \\
0&0
\end{pmatrix},~
M^b =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&0 \\
0&1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$  

Note, that the graph is an FSM: edges are transitions, all vertices should be both start and final at the same time.
Thus RPQ evaluation is an intersection of two FSMs, and the result also can be represented as FSM, because regular languages are closed under intersection.

\subsection{Context-Free Path Querying and Recursive State Machines}

More general case, than RPQ, is a \textit{Context-Free Path Querying Problem (CFPQ)}, where one can use context-free languages as constraints. These constraints are more expressive than regular ones, for example, one can express classical same-generation query using context-free language, but not a regular one.


\begin{definition} 
Context-free grammar $G = \langle\Sigma, N, S, P\rangle$ where $\Sigma$ is a finite set of terminals (or terminal alphabet), $N$ is a finite set of nonterminals (or nonterminal alphabet), $S \in N$ is a start nonterminal, and $P$ is a finite set of productions (grammar rules) of form $N_i \to \alpha$ where  $N_i \in N$, $\alpha \in (\Sigma \cup N)^*$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
The sequence $\omega_2 \in (\Sigma \cup N)^*$ is dervable from $\omega_1 \in (\Sigma \cup N)^*$ in one derivation step, or $\omega_1 \to \omega_2$, in the grammar $G = \langle\Sigma, N, S, P\rangle$ iff $\omega_1=\alpha N_i \beta$, $\omega_2 = \alpha \gamma \beta$, and $N_i \to \gamma \in P$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Context-free grammar $G=\langle\Sigma, N, S, P\rangle$ specifies a \textit{contex-free languege}: $\mathcal{L}(G) = \{\omega \mid S \xrightarrow{*} \omega \}$, where $(\xrightarrow{*})$ denotes zero or more derivation steps $(\to)$.    
\end{definition}

Thus, one can use the grammar $G_1 = \langle \{a,b\}, \{S\}, S, \{S \to a \ b; \ S \to a \ S \ b\} \rangle$ to find paths which form words in the language $\mathcal{L}(G_1) = \{a^n b^n \mid n > 0\}$ in the graph $\mathcal{G}$ (fig.~\ref{fig:example_input_graph}).

Regular expressions can be transormet to FSM, the similar way, context free grammar can be transformer to \textit{Recursive State Machime} (RSM) also known as recursive networks~\cite{!!!}, recursive automata~\cite{!!!}, !!!. 
In our work we use the following definition of RSM.
\begin{definition}
A recursive state machine $R$ over a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ is defined as a tuple of elements $(M,m,\{C_i\}_{i \in M})$, where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $M$ is a finite set of labels of boxes.
    \item $m \in M$ is an initial box label.
    \item Set of \textit{component state machines} or \textit{boxes},
          where $C_i=(\Sigma \cup M, Q_i,q_i^0,F_i,\delta_i)$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Sigma \cup M$ is a set of symbols, $\Sigma \cap M = \emptyset$
        \item $Q_i$ is a finite set of states,
              where $Q_i \cap Q_j = \emptyset, \forall i \neq j$
        \item $q_i^0$ is an initial state for $C_i$
        \item $F_i$ is a set of final states for $C_i$, where $F_i \subseteq Q_i$
        \item $\delta_i: Q_i \times (\Sigma \cup M) \to Q_i$ is a transition function for $C_i$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}

RSM behaves as a set of finite state machines (or FSM).
Each FSM is called a \textit{box} or a \textit{component state machine}~\cite{rsm:analysis:10.1007/3-540-44585-4_18}.
A box works almost the same as a classical FSM, but it also handles additional \textit{recursive calls} and employs an implicit \textit{call stack} to \textit{call} one component from another and then return execution flow back.

The execution of an RSM could be defined as sequence of the configuration transitions, which are done on input symbols reading. 
The pair $(q_i,S)$, where $q_i$ is current state for box $C_i$ and $S$ is stack of \textit{return states}, describes execution configurations. 

The RSM execution starts form configuration $(q_m^0, \langle\rangle)$. 
The following list of rules defines the machine transition from configuration $(q_i,S)$ to $(q',S')$ on some input symbol $a$ from input sequence, which is read as usual for FSA:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $q' \gets q_i^t, S' \gets S$, where $q_i^t = \delta_i (q_i^k, a), q_i^k = q$
    \item $q' \gets q_j^0, S' \gets q_i^t \circ S$, where $q_i^t = \delta_i (q_i^k, j),  q_i^k = q, j \in M$
    \item $q' \gets q_i^t, S' \gets S_{tail}$, where $S = q_i^t \circ S_{tail}, q_j^k = q, q_j^k \in F_j$
\end{itemize}

Some input sequence of the symbols $a_1 ... a_n$, which forms some input word, accepted, if machine reaches configuration $(q,\langle\rangle)$, where $q \in F_m$. It is also worth noting that the  RSM makes not deterministic transitions, without reading the input character when it \textit{calls} some component or  makes a \textit{return}.

According to~\cite{rsm:analysis:10.1007/3-540-44585-4_18}, recursive state machines are equivalent to pushdown systems.
Since pushdown systems are capable of accepting context-free languages~\cite{automata:theory:10.5555/1177300}, it is clear that RSMs are equivalent to context-free languages.
Thus RSMs suit to encode query grammars.
Any CFG can be easily converted to an RSM with one box per nonterminal.
The box which corresponds to a nonterminal $A$ is constructed using the right-hand side of each rule for $A$.
An example of such RSM $R$ constructed for the grammar $G$ with rules $S \to a S b \mid a b$ is provided in figure~\ref{example:automata}.

Since $R$ is a set of FSMs, it is useful to represent $R$ as an adjacency matrix for the graph where vertices are states from $\bigcup_{i \in M}Q_i$ and edges are transitions between $q_i^a$ and $q_i^b$ with label $l \in \Sigma \cup M$, if $\delta_i (q_i^a, l) = q_i^b$.
An example of such adjacency matrix $M_R$ for the machine $R$ is provided in section~\ref{example:section}.

\begin{figure}[h]

        \node[state, initial] (q_0)   {$q_S^0$};
        \node[state] (q_1) [right=of q_0] {$q_S^1$};
        \node[state] (q_2) [right=of q_1] {$q_S^2$};
        \node[state, accepting] (q_3) [right=of q_2] {$q_S^3$};

    \end{tikzpicture}

    \caption{The recursive state machine $R$ for grammar $G$}
    \label{example:automata}
\end{figure}



Similarly to FSM, RSM can be representaed as s graph and, hance, as a set of Boolean adjacency matrices/
For our example, $M_1$ is:
    $$
    M_1 =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    . & . & \{a\} & .     \\
    . & . & \{S\} & \{b\} \\
    . & . & . & \{b\}     \\
    . & . & . & .
    \end{pmatrix}
    $$

Matrix $M_1$ can be represented as a set of Boolean matrices as follows:
{\small
\begin{align*}
M_1^S =
\begin{pmatrix}      
    . & . & . & .   \\
    . & . & 1 & .   \\
    . & . & . & .   \\
    . & . & . & .   
\end{pmatrix},~M_1^a =
\begin{pmatrix}       
   . & . & 1 & .   \\
   . & . & . & .   \\
   . & . & . & .   \\
   . & . & . & .   \\
\end{pmatrix},~M_1^b =
\begin{pmatrix}      
    . & . & . & .   \\
    . & . & . & 1   \\
    . & . & . & 1   \\
    . & . & . & .   \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
}
Similarly to RPQ, CFPQ is an intersection of the given context-free language and FSM specified by the given graph.
As far as context-free is closed under intersection with regular languages, result can be represented as an RSM.
Also, one can look at the RSM as at FSM over $\Sigma \cup N$.
In this work we use this point of view to propose unified algorifm for evaluation both regular and contex-free path queryes with zero overhead for regular ones. 
 

\subsection{Graph Kronecker Product}



\begin{definition}
Given two edge-labelled directed graphs $\mathcal{G}_1=\langle V_1, E_1, L_1 \rangle$ and $\mathcal{G}_2=\langle V_2, E_2, L_2 \rangle$ the Kronecker product of these two graphs is a edge-labeles directed graph $\mathcal{G}=\langle V, E, L \rangle$ where 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $V = V_1 \times V_2$
	\item $E = \{((u,v),l,(p,q)) \mid (u,l,p) \in E_1 \wedge (v,l,q) \in E_2 \}$
	\item $L = L_1 \cap L_2$
\end{itemize}
 $\mathcal{G}_1 \otimes \mathcal{G}_2$ 
\end{definition}

Adjacency matrix is a tensot ptoduct of adjacency matrices

\begin{definition}
Matrix tensor product definition.
!!!!!
\end{definition}

Thus, $M(G) = M(G_1) \otimes M(G_2) = !!!!$


FSM intersection can be calcualeted as tensor product of FSM adjacency matrix.

Example!!!

Using adjacency matrix decompposition we can reduce Tensor product for FSM intersection over Boolean semiring using given definitions.

$$ M_1 \otimes M_2 = a \cdot (M_1^a \otimes M_2^a) + b \cdot (M_1^b \otimes M_2^b) $$

In this work we show how to express RSM and FSM intersection in terms of tensor product and transitive closure over Boolean semiring.
