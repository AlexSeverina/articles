\section{Introduction}

Context-free path querying (CFPQ) is becoming more popular in many areas, e. g. bioinformatics~\cite{Bio}, graph databases~\cite{graphDB} or static code analysis~\cite{zhang2013fast}. 
A query is presented as a context-free grammar and all possible paths (strings) are set as a directed labeled graph. 
This type of query increases the expressive power of commonly used regular expressions and therefore forms a promising research area.
The computation of such queries is parsing all paths in the input graph with respect to the given grammar. 
The result of the CFPQ evaluation is a set of triples $(A, m, n)$, such that a path from the node $m$ to the node $n$ exists in the given graph and a string obtained by concatenating the labels of the edges along this path is derived from nonterminal $A$ of the given context-free grammar.

A large amount of data is typical for most CFPQ application areas, so an especially pronounced problem is the search and development of high-performance algorithms.
The matrix-based algorithms, for example, ~\cite{azimov2018context}, are the most potential for practical tasks.
The possibility of applying various computing techniques to speed up matrix calculations, such as GPGPU or sparse matrix representation allows to improve the performance on the real-world data~\cite{mishin2019evaluation}.
But these algorithms, just like the others, suffer from computational problem issues and can be low-speed in some cases.

There are also several reasons to consider the applicability of numerical linear algebra and computational mathematics for CFPQ.
The benefits of matrix-based CFPQ algorithms (e.g. the utilization of parallel techniques) will remain.
Well-known linear algebra operations, such as matrix inversion or decomposition, can be used in the creation of better algorithms. 
For instance, there are several successful results of applying linear algebra methods to logic programming~\cite{sato2017linear, aspis2018linear}. 
Also, approximate computational methods can accelerate CFPQs processing.
And most importantly, the popularity of artificial intelligence techniques pushed the development and improvement of many efficient libraries for numerical computing.

In this article, we modify the matrix-based algorithm mentioned above and reduce GFPQ to solving the systems of Boolean matrix equations.
And then we propose a new approach for CFPQs processing, based on solving the systems of equations in the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.
We also assess the feasibility of using both accurate and approximate methods of computational mathematics.
The evaluation of our approach on a set of conventional benchmarks shows its applicability.

\section{Background}

Context-free grammar (CFG) is a triple $G=(N, \Sigma, R)$, where $N$ is a set of nonterminal symbols, $\Sigma$ is a set of terminal symbols and $R$ is a set of productions of the followings form: $A \Rightarrow \alpha$, $\alpha \in (N \cup \Sigma)^*$. 
$\mathcal{L}(G_S)$ denotes a language specified by CFG $G$ with respect to $S \in N$: $\mathcal{L}(G_S) = \{\omega~|~S \Rightarrow_{G}^{*} \omega\}$.

Directed graph is a triple $D = (V,E,\sigma)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices, $\sigma \subseteq \Sigma$ is a set of labels, and a set of edges $E\subseteq V\times \sigma \times V$. 
Denote a path from the node $m$ to the node $n$ in graph $D$ as $m\lambda n$, where
$\lambda$ is the unique word, obtained by concatenating the labels of the edges along this path.
P is a set of all paths in $D$.

For a graph $D$ and a CFG $G$, we define \emph{context-free relations} \mbox{$R_A \subseteq V \times V$} for each \mbox{$A \in N$}: $R_A = \{(m, n) \mid m\lambda n \in P, \lambda \in \mathcal{L}(G_A)\}.$

Matrix-based algorithm, proposed by Rustam Azimov ~\cite{azimov2018context}, processes CFPQs by using relational query semantics~\cite{hellings2015querying} and offloads the most time-consuming operations onto Boolean matrix multiplication, thus allowing significantly increase the performance~\cite{mishin2019evaluation}, but it takes time $\mathcal{O}(|V|^{4+\omega})$. 


\section{Equation-Based Approach}

In this section we transform matrix-based algorithm. 
We replace the calculation of matrices' products by the computation of several matrix equations.

For each $X \in (N \cup \Sigma)$ we create a Boolean matrix $T_X$. 
All matrices corresponding to nonterminals are fixed according to the input graph: $((T_a)_{ij} = 1 \iff (v_i, a, v_j) \in E)$ for $a \in \Sigma$. 
And for each $A \in N$: $((T_A)_{ij} = 1 \iff (i, j) \in R_A)$.


Let's consider a simple CFG $G_1 : S \rightarrow aSb \mid ab$ and its representation in Chomsky normal form: $G_1 : S \rightarrow AS_1 \mid AB$; $ S_1 \rightarrow SB$; $ A \rightarrow a$; $B \rightarrow b$.
In the matrix-based algorithm we construct a matrix transitive closure in a while loop and on each iteration Boolean matrices is changing in 3 calculations (rules $ A \rightarrow a$ and $B \rightarrow b$ are not used after matrices initialization). It can be replaced into a simple iterative process:

\begin{center}
\(
\left. 
\begin{array}{l}
T_{S_1} = T_{S_1} + T_ST_b \\
T_S = T_S + T_aT_{S_1} \\ 
T_S = T_S + T_aT_b
\end{array} 
\right\}
\Rightarrow 
\left. 
\begin{array}{l}
T_S^0 = \mathbf{0} \\
T_S^{k+1} = T_a T_S^k T_b + T_a T_b
\end{array} 
\right.
\)
\end{center}

$\{ T_S^k\}$ is a monotonically increasing series of Boolean matrices. 
It converges and the limit $T_S^*$ is the least solution of Boolean matrix equation:

\begin{center}
\(
\left. 
\begin{array}{l}
T_S = T_AT_ST_B + T_AT_B
\end{array} 
\right.
\)
\end{center}

Unfortunately, this modification does not entail any meaningful improvements. 
But we can consider another equation over $\mathbb{R}$:

\begin{center}
\(
\left. 
\begin{array}{l}
\mathcal{T}_S = \epsilon(T_A \mathcal{T}_S T_B + T_A T_B)
\end{array}
\right.
\)
\end{center}

And the corresponding matrix series $\{ \mathcal{T}_S^{k}\}$, which converges to $\mathcal{T}_S^*$ when $\mathcal{T}_S^{k} \leq \textbf{1}$ as a a monotonically increasing series of matrices with an upper bound:

\begin{center}
\(
\left.
\begin{array}{c}
\mathcal{T}_S^0 = \mathbf{0} \\
\mathcal{T}_S^{k+1} = \epsilon(T_A \mathcal{T}_S^k T_B + T_A T_B).
\end{array} 
\right.
\)
\end{center}

It can be proved that $((\mathcal{T}_S^{k+1})_{ij} > 0 \iff (T_S^{k+1})_{ij} = 1)$ and $ceil(\mathcal{T}_S^*) = T_S^*$, where $ceil(x)$ returns the smallest integer not less than $x$.

So, each rule of the following form $X \rightarrow V \ldots W \mid \dots \mid Y \ldots Z$, where $X \in N$, $V, W, \ldots , Y, Z \in (N \cup \Sigma)$ can be replaced by equation:
$T_X = \epsilon_X (T_V \cdot \ldots \cdot T_W + \dots + T_Y \cdot \ldots \cdot T_Z)$, where $\epsilon_X$ is chosen such that $\mathcal{T}_X^{k} \leq \textbf{1}$ for each $k$.

Mostly we deal with the systems of matrix equations. Let's briefly consider the possible cases of these systems.

\textbf{Linear Equations}

If the input CFG is linear, each equation of the system is of the form of generalized Sylvester equation: $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} A_iXB_i = C$.
For $k = 1, 2$ we can solve it in $\mathcal{O}(|V|^3)$.
Otherwise, for $k > 2$ it can be reduced using Kronecker product to solving a linear system $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a matrix of size $(|V|^2 \times |V|^2)$ and time required to compute its solution is $\mathcal{O}(|V|^6)$ or $\mathcal{O}(|V|^{4\omega + 2})$ with more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms. 
The use of sparse matrix representation can be very efficient for solving the equations of this type.

For the system of equations, we construct the dependency graph $D_G$ for nonterminals of the given grammar $G$ and split the set of the equations into the disjoint subsets accordingly to the set of strongly connected components in $D_G$, which can be found in $\mathcal{O}(|V| + |E|)$.
Then we solve our system in stages, for each subset.

\textbf{Nonlinear Equations}

For the nonlinear case we can rewrite each equation of the form $X = \Psi(X)$ to the equivalent $F(X) = X - \Psi(X) = 0$ and use Newton's method for nonlinear functions root finding:

\begin{center}
\(
\left.
\begin{array}{c}
F(X) = \mathbf{0}, X_0 \\
\end{array} 
\right.
\)

\(
\left. 
\begin{array}{l}
X_{i+1} = X_i - (F'(X_i))^{-1}F(X_i) 
\end{array} 
\right.
\iff 
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
F'(X_i)H_i = - F(X_i) \\
X_{i+1} = X_i + H_i
\end{array} 
\right.
\)
\end{center}

Here $X_0$ is an initial guess, in our case $X_0 = $ \textbf{0}, as our solution is a matrix consists of small positive numbers. 
The convergence of this method can be quadratic which allows finding the solution significantly faster.
Even as it is necessary to solve an equation for $H_i$ (also generalized Sylvester equation) on each iteration step, the majority of high-performance implementations do not compute the Jacobian inverse and use its approximate value.

The main difficulty in using Newton's method is choosing an appropriate $\epsilon$, to ensure the least positive solution for nonlinear equations $\epsilon$ must be smaller than $\frac{1}{|V|}$.


\section{Evaluation}

The equation-based approach for CFPQ was implemented.
We evaluated \textbf{Query 2}~\cite{azimov2018context}.
The equation constructed for this query were resolved on the CPU by two different ways using Python package \textit{scipy}: 
\textbf{sSLV} --- solving as a sparse linear system using \textit{spsolve}
and
\textbf{dNWT} --- funding roots of a function using \textit{optimize.newton\texttt{\_}krylov}.

\begin{table}[h]

\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

We compare (Table ~\ref{tbl2}) the results with the first matrix-based algorithm implementations described in ~\cite{azimov2018context}. 
Our approach demonstrates that it can be applied on real-world data as well as the matrix-based algorithm. 
Moreover, we can improve the performance by the utilization of parallel techniques for matrix operations.

\section{Conclusion and future work}

We proposed a new approach for CFPQs processing, based on solving the systems of equations over $\mathbb{R}$.
The evaluation of our approach on a set of conventional benchmarks showed its practical applicability on real-world data.

The directions for future research are high-performance implementation using GPGPU or other parallel techniques. 
Also, it seems interesting to determine the subclasses of (system of) polynomial equations whose solution can be reduced to CFPQ and try to construct bidirectional reduction between CFPQ and these subclasses, thereby finding efficient solutions for both these problems at a time.
