\subsection{Context-Free Path Querying}

Graph, grammar, etc.

Let $i\pi j$ denote a unique path between nodes $i$ and $j$ of the graph and $l(\pi)$ denotes a unique string which is obtained from the concatenation of edge labels along the path $\pi$.
For a context-free grammar $G = (\Sigma, N, P, S)$ and directed labelled graph $D = (Q, \Sigma, \delta)$, a triple $(A, i, j)$ is \textit{realizable} iff there is a path $i\pi j$ such that nonterminal $A \in N$ derives $l(\pi)$.

\subsection{Planar Graphs}

A planar graph is a graph that can be embedded in the plane...
