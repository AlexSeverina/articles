\section{Introduction}

Data-centric applications, data access, languages integration for graph-structured data (or graph DB) access.

Navigation queries.
Path querying and context-free path querying.
Same generation query is not a regular.
Static code analysis.

Integration with general purpose programming languages is a problem.
String-embedded DSLs.
Special DSL vs Combinators (LINQ~\cite{LINQ1, LINQ2}, etc)~\cite{ScalaGraphParsing}

We propose !!! and we make the following contributions in this paper.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Combinators for CF path querying with structural representation of result.
 Transparent integration of query language into general-purpose programming language.
\item Implementation in Scala. Generalization of linear parsing. Integration with Neo4J graph data base. Available on gitHub:\url{https://github.com/YaccConstructor/Meerkat}
\item Evaluation on realistic data, which shows that it is applicable. Comparison  with other tools 
for CF path querying.
\end{enumerate}
