\section{Introduction}

Graph data bases

Path querying and context-free path querying.
Same generation query is not a regular.

Integration with general purpose programming languages.
Special DSL vs Combinators (LINQ, etc)~\cite{ScalaGraphParsing}

Contribution:
\begin{itemize}
\item Combinators for CF path querying with structural representation of result
\item Implementation in Scala. Available on gitHub:\url{https://github.com/YaccConstructor/Meerkat}
\item Evaluation on realistic data, which shows that it is applicable.
\end{itemize}
