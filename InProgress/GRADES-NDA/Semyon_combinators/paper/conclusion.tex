\section{Conclusion}

We propose a native way to integrate language for context-free path querying into general purpose programming language.
Our solution can handle arbitrary context-free grammars and arbitrary graphs.
Proposed approach is language-independent and may be implemented for closely all general-purpose programming languages.
We implement it in Scala programming language and show that our implementation can be applied for real problems.

We can propose some possible directions of future work.
Firs of all it is necessary to extend library with combinators for vertices information processing.
The next technical improvement is crateion of user-friendly interface for SPPF processing.
For example, SPPF can be presented as a set of paths with additional information about its structure.
It may be useful for SPPF utilization for debugging and query result processing.

Another direction is semantic actions or attributed grammars handling.
It is useful for specification user-defined actions, such as filters, over subqueryes result, which can make queryes more expressive.
It is impossible in general case, but some techniques such as lazy evaluations can help to provide a technically appropriate solution.
An important theoretcal question is for which class of sematic actions it is possible to provide precise general solution.
