\section{Conclusion}

We propose a native way to integrate language for language-constrained path querying into general purpose programming language.
We implement it and show that our implementation can be applied for real  problems.
Arbitrary context-free grammars for querying.
This approach is language-independent and may bi implemented for closely all general-purpose programming languages.

Code is available on GitHub: 

Future work is

Technical improvements: sppf as a set of paths, combinators for vertices information processing, etc

SPPF utilization for debugging and results processing

Attributed grammars processing to provide mechanim for semantics calcualtion, filtration, etc
