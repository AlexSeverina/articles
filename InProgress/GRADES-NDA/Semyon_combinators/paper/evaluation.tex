\subsection {Classical RDFs}

\textbf{Query 1} is based on the grammar for retrieving concepts on the same layer (presented in figure~\ref{grammarQ1}).
For this query our algorithm demonstrates up to 1000 times better performance and provides identical results as compared to the presented in~\cite{CFGonRDF} for $Q_1$.

\end{array}

\textbf{Query 2} is based on the grammar for retrieving concepts on the adjacent layers (presented in figure~\ref{grammarQ2}). 
Note that this query differs from the original query $Q_2$ from the paper~\cite{CFGonRDF} in the following points.
First of all, we count only triples for the nonterminal $S$ because only paths derived from it correspond to the paths between concepts on adjacent layers.
Algorithm presented in~\cite{CFGonRDF} returns triples for all nonterminals.
Moreover, the grammar $\mathcal{G}_2$ presented in~\cite{CFGonRDF}, describes paths not only between concepts on adjacent layers.
For example, path ``$\text{\textit{subClassOf} \textit{subClassOf}}^{-1}$'' can be derived in $\mathcal{G}_2$, but it is a path between concepts on the same layer, not adjacent.
We changed the grammar to fit the query to the description provided in the paper~\cite{CFGonRDF}. 
Thus results of our query differs from results for $Q_2$ which can be found in~\cite{CFGonRDF}.

\end{array}
