Special graph query languages. SPARQL, cypher

Languge integration problem: special DSLs for SQL, ORM, Linq

Parser-combinators is one of classical approach for parsing!!!.

Scala combinators for graph~\cite{ScalaGraphParsing} --- one of attempt to adopt combinators 
technique for graph processing.
But language class is not discussed.

Classical combinators has restrictions: left-recursive grammars.
GLL~\cite{scott2010gll} can handle arbitrary context-free grammars, SPPF~\cite{SPPF}

Parser combinators library bsed on GLL ---
