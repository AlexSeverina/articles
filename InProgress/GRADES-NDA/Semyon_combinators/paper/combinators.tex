\section{Parser-Combitators for Path Querying}

In this section we present our implementation of and describe some details.

Our implenemtation is based on Meerkat library. 
We need only some steps for generalization.

As far as linear input is a one of case of graph, it is possible to provide input abstraction which 
make possible to generalize combinators.

The set of implemented combinators:

SPPF may be an arbitrary graph in opposite of linear input parsing.

Let we introduce an example. 

Graph.

Grammar.

In terms of combinators from roposed library.

Interface for Neo4J~\footnote{The graph data dase implemented in Java} graph bata base

Extensible solution: you need only implement an interface (really?)

An architecture of the solution.
