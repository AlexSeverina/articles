\section{Parser-Combitators for Path Querying}

In this section we present our implementation of and describe some details.

Our implenemtation is based on Meerkat library. 
We need only some steps for generalization.

As far as linear input is a one of case of graph, it is possible to provide input abstraction which 
make possible to generalize combinators.

SPPF may be an arbitrary graph in opposite of linear input parsing.

Let we introduce an example. 
Graph.
Grammar.
In terms of combinators.


Interface for Neo4J bata base

Extensible solution

An architecture of the solution.
