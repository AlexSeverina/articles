\section{\bf Conclusion}

In this paper we presented the modification of Valiant's algorithm, which made it possible to use parallel computations more effectively. Also we show its applicability for the string-matching problem the original version could not deal with.

The priority direction for our future research are high-performance implementation using GPGPU or other parallel techniques 
and its evaluation on real-world data.
