\section{\bf Conclusion}

We presented the modification of Valiant's algorithm, which makes it possible to use parallel computations more effectively. 
Also we showed its applicability to the string-matching problem the original algorithm was not able to deal with.

The directions for future research are high-performance implementation using GPGPU or other parallel techniques and its evaluation on the real-world data.

Also we plan to extend the proposed algorithm for conjunctive and boolean grammars handling. It should be useful for complex secondary structure features processing.
