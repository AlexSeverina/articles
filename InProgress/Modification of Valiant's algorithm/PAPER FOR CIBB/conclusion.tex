\section{\bf Conclusion}

We presented the modification of Valiant's algorithm, which makes it possible to use parallel computations more efficiently. 
Also we showed its applicability to the string-matching problem with which the original algorithm was not able to work.

The directions for future research are high-performance implementation using GPGPU or other parallel techniques and its evaluation on the real-world data.

We also plan to extend the proposed algorithm for conjunctive and boolean grammars handling.
It will be useful for complex secondary structure features processing.
