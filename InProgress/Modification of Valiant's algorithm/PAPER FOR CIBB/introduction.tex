\section{\bf Introduction}

The secondary structure of such genomic squences as RNAs is related to biological functions of various organisms.
Thus, the analysis of the secondary structure of genomic sequences plays an important role in organisms classification and recognition problems.

Specific features of secondary structure can be described by some context-free grammar (CFG).
As a result, there is a number of approaches to sequences analysis wich utilize parsing: verification whether some sequence can be derived in specified grammar.
For example, some approaches to secondary structure analysis model string with correleted symbols with probabilistic formal grammars~\cite{knudsen1999rna, dowell2004evaluation}.
For some problems, it is necessary to find  all derivibel substrings of the gien string~\cite{durbin1996biological}.
This case is similar to string-matching problem, but templete, or pattern, is described by using formal grammar.

Most CFG-based approaches suffer the same issue: the computational complexity is bad.
Traditionally used CYK~\cite{kasami1966efficient, Younger:1966:CLP:1441427.1442019} runs with a cubic time complexity, demonstrates poor performance on long strings or big grammars~\cite{liu2005parallel}.
We argu that in such field as bioinformatics where large amount of data is usual, more efficient algorithms are needed.
Moreover, in some cases context-free grammars are not enough, and more expressive grammars are requred.
For example, it is possible to express pseudoknots by using conjunctive grammars~\cite{zier2013rna}, while it is impossible by using context-free one.

Asymptotically most efficient parsing algorithm is Valiant's algorithm~\cite{Valiant:1975:GCR:1739932.1740048} which is based on matrix multiplication.
Moreover, Okhotin generalized this algorithm to conjunctive and Boolean grammars which are the natural extensions of CFG with more expressive power~\cite{Okhotin:2014:PMM:2565359.2565379}.
Valiantâ€™s algorithm allows to simply utilize parallel techniques to improve performance by offloading critical computations onto matrices multiplication.
However, this algorithm is not appropriate for substrings finding problem.

In this paper we present the modification of Valiant's algorithm, which increases the power of using GPGPU and parallel computations by computing some matrices products concurrently.
Also proposed algorithm can be easily adopted for the string-matching, or string-searching, problem.
