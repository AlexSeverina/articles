\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

The main goal of this work was to find an effective solution for the string-matching problem that arose at the intersection of the theory of formal languages and bioinformatics. We proposed a modification of Valiant's algorithm partially dealing with this problem. Also we proved its applicability by showing the asymptotic complexity concerning substring searching.
