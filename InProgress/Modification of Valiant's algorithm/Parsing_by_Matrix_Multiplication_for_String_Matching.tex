\begin{abstract}
Recent  research  has  shown  that the theory of formal languages can be used in bioinformatics. While using parsing for processing nucleotide sequences it became necessary to find an easily adaptable to the string-matching problem parsing algorithm, and as such field of application as bioinformatics requires working with large amount of data, it should be highly efficient. The asymptotically fastest parsing algorithm was proposed by Valiant and based on matrix multiplication. The original version of matrix-based algorithm is difficult to apply to the string-matching problem. In this paper we present  a modification  of Valiant's  algorithm dealing with the problem mentioned above. The modification has a succinct proof of correctness and is implemented.
