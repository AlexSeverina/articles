\section{Conclusion}

We propose and implment in C\# programming language the generic framework for interprocedural static code analysis implementation.
This framefork allows one to implement srbitrary interprocedural analysis in terms of CFL-reachability.
By using proposed framework, we implement a plugin upon ReSharper infrastructure which provides simple taint analysis and demonstarate that our solution can handle importatnt real-world cases.
Also we show that proposed framwork can be used for real-world solutions analysis.

One of the directions for future work is a creation of analysis and its evaluation on real-world projects.
By this way we want to get informantion which helps to improve usability of our framwork: tune performance, improve API, etc.
Also we should improve documentation and create more examples of usage.

Enother direction is practical evaluation of automatic fix location prediction by using minimum cuts method~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-63390-9_27}.
