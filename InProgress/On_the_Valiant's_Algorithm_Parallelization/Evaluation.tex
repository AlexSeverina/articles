\section{Evaluation}

After demonstrating the theoretical value of the proposed solution, the next step of our work was to show its applicability on real data. Both algorithms (original Valiant's version and the modification) were compared on context-free grammar G  ...?picture?...  which is used to approximate the secondary structure of the biological sequences. As it was mentioned before, the secondary structure is a very powerful instrument for species classification and identification problem. Parsing algorithms based on matrix multiplication helps efficiently find subsequences with features specific to the secondary structure.

The algorithms were implemented using a library for fast Boolean matrix multiplication M4RI~\cite{m4ri}. The biological sequences were taken from this dataset[].

All tests were run on a PC with the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item OS:
\item CPU:
\item System Type:
\item RAM:
\end{itemize}

The results of experiments which are presented ?...? show that our modification can be efficiently applied to the string matching problem as it demonstrates good time on real data.
