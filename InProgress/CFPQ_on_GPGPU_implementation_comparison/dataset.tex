\section{Dataset description}

We create and publish a dataset for CFPQ algorithms evaluation.
This dataset contains both the real data and syntetic data for different cpecific cases, such as theoretical worst case, or matrices representation specific wirst cases.

All data is presented in text-based format to simplify usage in different environments.
Grammars are in Chomscy Normal Form and are stored in the files with \verb|yrd| extension.
Each line is a rule in form of triple or pair. 
The example of grammar representation is presented in figure~\ref{fig:grammar_example}

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.24\textwidth}
        \centering
        \[
         \begin{array}{rcl}
           s & \rightarrow & A \ s \ B \\
           s & \rightarrow & A \ B 
         \end{array}        
         \]

     s1 s b

     b B

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Example of grammar representation in the \texttt{yrd} file}
    \label{fig:grammar_example}
\end{figure}



Graphs are represented as a set of triples (edges) and are stored in the files with \verb|txt| extension. 
Example of graph is presented in figure~\ref{fig:graph_example}.

\begin{figure}[h]
 \begin{verbatim}
   0 A 1
   1 A 2
   2 A 0
   0 B 4
   4 B 0
 \end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

Each case is a pair of set of graphs and set of grammars.
Cases are placed in folders with case-specific name.
Grammars and graph are placed in subfolders with names \verb|Grammars| and \verb|Matrices| respectively.

The datatset includes data for next cases.
\begin{itemize}
\item RDFs from ~\cite{!!!} and two variants of the same generation query which is classical queries for CFPQ~\cite{!!!}.
\item Worst case for CFPQ which is proposed by Hellings~\cite{!!!Hellings}.
\item Cycle to full
\item Sparse graphs from~\cite{fan2018scaling}. Query is a same generation query
\end{itemize}
