\section{Dataset description}

We created and published a dataset for CFPQ algorithms evaluation.
This dataset contains both the real-world data and synthetic data for different specific cases, such as the theoretical worst case, or matrices representation specific worst cases.

Our goal is to evaluate querying algorithms, not a graph storages or graph databases, so all data is presented in a text-based format to simplify usage in different environments.
Grammars are in Chomsky Normal Form, and graphs are represented as a list of triples (edges).
For details on data representation look at the appendix.

It is known that variants of the \textit{same generation query}~\cite{FndDB} are a important example of queries that are context-free but not regular, so we use this type of queries in our evaluation.
The datatset includes data for next cases.
Each case is a pair of set of graphs and a set of grammars: each query (grammar) should be applied to each graph.

\textbf{[RDF]} The set of real-world RDF files (ontologies) from~\cite{RDF} and two variants of the same generation query (figure~\ref{fig:grammar_rdf} in appendix) which describes hierarchy analysis.

\textbf{[Worst]} Theoretical worst case for CFPQ time complexity which is proposed by Hellings~\cite{hellingsPathQuerying}: the graph is two cycles of coprime lengths with a single common vertex.
The first cycle is labeled by an open bracket and the second cycle is labeled by a close bracket.
Query is a grammar for $A^nB^n$ languge (grammar $G_1$, figure~\ref{fig:grammar_example} in appendix).

\textbf{[Full]} The case when the input graph is sparse, but the result is a full graph.
Such a case may be hard for sparse matrices representation.
As an input graph, we use a cycle, all edges of which are labeled by the same token.
As a query we use two grammars which describe sequence of tokens of arbitrary length: simple ambiguous grammar $G_2$  and highly ambiguous grammar $G_3$ (figure~\ref{fig:grammar_full} in appendix).

\textbf{[Sparse]} Sparse graphs from~\cite{fan2018scaling} generated by the GTgraph graph generator, and emulates realistic sparse data.
Names of these graphs have a form \texttt{Gn-p}, where \texttt{n} represents the total number of vertices, each pair of vertices is connected by probability \texttt{p}.
The query is the same generation query represented by grammar $G_1$ (figure~\ref{fig:grammar_example} in appendix).
