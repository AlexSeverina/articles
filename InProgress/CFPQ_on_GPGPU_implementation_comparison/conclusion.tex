\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We present !!!

Our evaluation shows that !!!

First direction for future research is a more detailed CFPQ algorithms investigation.
We should do More evaluation on sparse matrices on GPGPUs.

Also it is nesessary to implement and evaluate solutions for graphs which is not fit in RAM.
There is a set of technics for huge matrices multiplication.
Is it possible to dopt it for CFPQ

Another direcion is a dataset improvement.
More data.
More grammars/queries.
