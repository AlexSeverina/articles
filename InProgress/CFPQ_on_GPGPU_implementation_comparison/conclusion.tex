\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We provide a number of implementations of matrix-based algorithm for context-free path querying, collect a dataset for evaluation and provide results of evaluation of our implementation on collected dataset.
Our evaluation shouws that!!!

log cfg. datalog -> cfg or to boolean/conjunctive

First direction for future research is a more detailed CFPQ algorithms investigation.
We should do more evaluation on sparse matrices on GPGPUs.

Also it is nesessary to implement and evaluate solutions for graphs which is not fit in RAM.
There is a set of technics for huge matrices multiplication.
Is it possible to dopt it for CFPQ

Another direcion is a dataset improvement.
First of all, it is necessary to collect more data, and more grammars/queries.
Especially it would be interesting to add to dataset more real graphs and more real queryes.
Secondly, it is nesessary to !!! data format to be able to evaluate different algorithms.
Collaboration with community is requred.
