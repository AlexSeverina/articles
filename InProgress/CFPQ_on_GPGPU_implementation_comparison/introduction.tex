\section{Introduction}

Graph querying, Context-Free Path Querying (CFPQ), applications in different areas.
Performance is important for practical tasks.

Matrix-based algorithm.
Pretty simple.
Performance problems.
CPU/GPGPU based implementation.
Investigate and compare.

There is no publically available standartized dataset for algorithms evaluation.
We collect some data and propose possible candidate for it. 

Research question: comparison of differend implementations of matrix-based CFPQ.
We implement and compare peformance.

We make the following contributions in this paper.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implementation. Source code is available on GitHub:\url{!!!}
\item Dataset for evaluation. Real and syntethic data. Available. Data format. Reference values.
\item Evaluation. We show that !!!
\end{enumerate}
