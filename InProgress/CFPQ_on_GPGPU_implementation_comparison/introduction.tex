\section{Introduction}

Graph querying, Context-Free Path Querying (CFPQ), applications in different areas.
Performance is important for practical tasks.

Matrix-based algorithm.
Pretty simple.
Performance problems.
CPU/GPGPU based implementation.
Investigate and compare.

There is no publically available standartized dataset for algorithms evaluation.
We collect some data and propose possible candidate for it. 

Research question: comparison of differend implementations of matrix-based CFPQ.
We implement and compare peformance.
