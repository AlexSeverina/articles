\section{Introduction}

Language-constrained path querying~\cite{!!!}, and particulary Context-Free Path Querying (CFPQ)~\cite{!!!} widely used for graph-structured data analysis in such areas as biological data analysis, RDF, network analysis.
Real-world data is huge, so performance of CFPQ evaluation is important for practical tasks.
Resently active research !!! ~\cite{!!!}

One of the most promising algorithm is a matrix-based algorithm, proposed by Rustam Azimov.
This algorith is pretty simple for implementattion and allow to utilize massive-parallel hardware for CFPQs evaluation by offloading the most critical computattions to matrices multiplication.
CPU/GPGPU based implementation.
Investigate and compare.

There is no publically available standartized dataset for algorithms evaluation.
We collect some data and propose possible candidate for it. 

Research question: comparison of differend implementations of matrix-based CFPQ.
We implement and compare peformance.

We make the following contributions in this paper.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implementation. Source code is available on GitHub:\url{!!!}
\item Dataset for evaluation. Real and syntethic data. Available. Data format. Reference values.
\item Evaluation. We show that !!!
\end{enumerate}
