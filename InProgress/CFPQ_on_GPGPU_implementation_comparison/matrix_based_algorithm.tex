\section{Matrix-based Algorithm for CFPQ}

Matrix-based algoritm for CFPQ was proposed by Rustam Azimov~\cite{Azimov:2018:CPQ:3210259.3210264}.
This algorithm ...
It was shown that GPGPU utilization for queryes evaluation can significantly improve performance.

Pseudocode and notes. Performance-critical section is matrix multiplication!

We implement this algoritms by using different approaches for matrices multipliation.
