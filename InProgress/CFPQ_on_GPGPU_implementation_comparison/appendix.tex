\section{Details of dataset description}

Here we present some details on collected dataset.
Grammars (queries) are stored in the files with the \verb|yrd| extension.
Each line is a rule in the form of a triple or a pair.
Graphs are stored in the files with the \verb|txt| extension.
Example of the graph is presented in figure~\ref{fig:graph_example}.

Cases for evaluation are placed in folders with the case-specific name.
Grammars and graphs are placed in subfolders with names \verb|Grammars| and \verb|Matrices| respectively.
