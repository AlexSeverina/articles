\section{Introduction} % in progress

General Purpose Graphical Processor Units, or GPGPUs, are commonly used for fast computations. Their multi-core architecture benefits high-load computations in applied science, computer vision, bioinformatics and other areas~\cite{CUDA_to_OpenCL, GPGPU_1}.

Several frameworks for GPGPU programming are known. The most popular one is CUDA, a platform for parallel GPGPU computations developed by Nvidia in 2007~\cite{CUDA}. Another important project is Open Computing Language (OpenCL), an open standard for cross-platform parallel computing on different platforms, including GPGPU~\cite{OpenCL}. CUDA and OpenCL functions execuded on a GPGPU device are called \textit{kernels}.

The technologies mentioned provide special programming languages: CUDA C/C++, OpenCL C/C++. However using higher-level languages, such as C\# or F\#, can be more convenient for GPGPU development for the following reasons: they are used more often for general software development, and they are strongly and statically typed, which, with the help of integrated development environments (IDEs), facilitates development and improves the reliability of software. In this article, in context of GPGPU development, we are going to call programming in special CUDA/OpenCL languages \textit{lower-level development}, and coding in C\#/F\# \textit{higher-level development}.

There are several instruments for higher-level GPGPU development. AleaGPU~\cite{AleaGPU} is a commercial product that allows using C\# and F\# for CUDA programming, and calling a limited number of included lower-level CUDA libraries. The work~\cite{FSCL} presents FSCL, an F\# to OpenCL compiler, which allows developing OpenCL kernels within the .NET environment. A limited subset of F\# language is supported by FSCL compiler. Brahma.FSharp~\cite{Brahma_FSharp} is another F\# to OpenCL compiler, but it differs from FSCL in that it focuses on translating F\# \textit{quotations}, not regular code. F\# quotations are specific expressions that are not compiled as part of program, but instead are compiled into objects that represent F\# expressions, and can be evaluated later with F\# language tools. Moreover, Brahma.FSharp is under active development, while FSCL has not been updated since January, 2016.

There are also tools for managing GPGPU code launches from .NET. As mentioned earlier, Alea GPU allows reusing some CUDA libraries. CUSP~\cite{CUSP} is a C++ library that enhances CUDA development with sparse linear algebra and graph computations. ManagedCUDA~\cite{ManagedCUDA} library allows to run arbitrary pre-compiled CUDA kernels from C\#, however the calls are untyped, which doesn't satisfy the need for a completely type-safe environment.

To our knowledge, neither of the existing solutions allows both programming for GPGPU in higher-level programming languages and calling arbitrary OpenCL C code in a strongly typed way. In our work we are trying to solve this problem by augmenting Brahma.FSharp project with a new component that loads OpenCL C source files with a mechanism called type provider.

\section{F\# type providers}

A type provider~\cite{syme2012strongly} (TP) is a component of F\# programming language that provides types, properties and methods during runtime~\cite{TypeProviders}. One major application of F\# type providers is integration with dynamic data sources, such as SQL, CSV, JSON, in a strongly typed way~\cite{FSharpData}. Type providers can have static parameters and thus receive configuration, data source etc. as arguments. Therefore, type providers allow the user to interact with data from dynamic sources (such as file) in a statically typed way.

One relevant example is R~Type Provider~\cite{R_TP}. It enables interlopability between F\# and R by discovering installed R packages and making them available as .NET namespaces underneath the parent namespace RProvider. Another example is SQL Type Provider~\cite{SQL_TP} that connects the F\# environment in IDE to database sources and allows to explore them in a type-safe manner.

A common alternative to type providers is code generation. However, type providers ensure better integration with user context because they work at runtime, while the generated code must be replaced each time the data source is modified. Thus the threat of dissynchronization with the data source is eliminated.

Type providers also have disadvantages. First of all, testing type providers is very challenging because an IDE instance with any code that uses a TP, including unit tests, locks the DLL that contains the type providers and thus prevents rebuilding it. Also, debugging a type provider is a challenging process that requires two IDE instances and ususual setup, and editing TP is still impossible until the other IDE instance is closed.

\section{OpenCL type provider}

Figure~\ref{architecture} summarizes the proposed solution: the OpenCL type provider which is implemented as a part of Brahma.FSharp. The type provider loads the specified OpenCL C file, performs lexing, parsing and generates an F\# type with static functions that have the same signatures as the original OpenCL functions.

To use OpenCL type provider in a project, the user has to include the DLL containing the TP. Then, the KernelProvider type should be initialized with the proper static parameters, which there are two:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{PathToFile} specifies the path to the OpenCL C source file being included;
  \item \textit{TreatPointersAsArrays} defines whether the function parameters in OpenCL source code that are pointers are represented in F\# environment with the corresponding array type or reference type (ByRef in F\#).
\end{itemize}

The generated type provides all funcions from the OpenCL C file as static F\# functions. Listing~\ref{lst:usage} shows an example of TP usage: the file \textit{mygemm.cl} is included, and the function myGEMM1 from that file is generated within the provided type in F\#.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{graphics/architecture.pdf}
\caption{Overview of the solution}
\label{architecture}
\end{figure}

% \begin{figure}[h]

\lstset{language=FSharp}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  caption={Example of TP usage},
  label=lst:usage,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize,%\tiny, %or \small or \footnotesize etc.
  captionpos=b
]
let [<Literal>] clSourcePath = __SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + "/MyGEMM/mygemm.cl"
type ProvidedType = KernelProvider<clSourcePath, TreatPointersAsArrays=true>
let f = ProvidedType.myGEMM1
\end{lstlisting}

The screenshots below show examples of how the proposed type provider enhances the development process. Type information of the reused code becomes available (figure~\ref{pic:intellisense}), as well as code suggestions (figure~\ref{pic:suggestions}). Compile-time type check of interactions with the reused code is performed (figure~\ref{pic:error}).

\section{Discussion}

OpenCL is a text-based driver, so OpenCL C source code, both reused and generated with Brahma.FSharp, is passed to it for execution. Therefore, our type provider does not analyze the internals of the loaded files and only parses functions' signatures. The F\# functions generated by the type provider cannot be called, and are intended only for usage in quotations that are translated to OpenCL code via Brahma.FSharp.

Running OpenCL code on different devices requires proper configuration of parameters such as grid size and tile size. Brahma.FSharp allows to set grid parameters, but does not allow to pass arbitrary constants. Therefore, header files (.h) containing \#define preprocessor macros may be requred along with the reused OpenCL C code. In the future we hope to find a way to mitigate this restriction.
