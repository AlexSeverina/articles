\section{Conclusion and future works}

We presented a modification of Valiant's algorithm which makes it possible to process each matrix in layer independently and use parallel computations more efficiently.
This new algorithm can efficiently handle the problem of finding all substrings of a specified length.
The proposed algorithm is accompanied by proof of correctness and computational complexity analysis.
We showed the practical applicability of our modification. 
Concurrent processing of matrices in layer significantly increases the performance of GPU-based solution. 
Also, the modification can find all substrings much faster than Valiant's algorithm through the possibility to stop parsing matrix filling.

The directions for future research is to extend the proposed algorithm for conjunctive and Boolean grammars handling.
It will be useful for complex secondary structure features processing.
