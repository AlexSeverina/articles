\section{Conclusion}

We presented a modification of Valiant's algorithm, which makes it possible to use parallel computations more efficiently. 
Also we showed its applicability to the string-matching problem with which the original algorithm was not able to work.

The directions for future research is to extend the proposed algorithm for conjunctive and boolean grammars handling.
It will be useful for complex secondary structure features processing.
