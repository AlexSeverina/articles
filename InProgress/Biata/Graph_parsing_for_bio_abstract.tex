\maketitle

Biomedical databases contain vast amounts of rich data, much of which can be represented as a labeled graph.
One of exampes is a raph where vertices correspond to entities and concepts labeled with their types such as gene, phenotype, and edges represent known relationships such as ``codes for'', ``interacts with'', etc.
%Uniprot
Paths with special constraints may provide information about links between vertices were unknown before, forming the basis for new hypotheses.

Another example of graph structured data is metagenomic assemblies.
Secondary structure can be described in terms of context-free grammar (Eddy et al), and grammar can be used for finding and classification.
But for linear data. 
dispird the fact of tools existing, Graph structured data processing is still a challenge
Context-free pattern search in metagenomical assemblies. 

Solution of problems described defore can be based on is a context-free path querying for graph data bases where input is a graph and path constraints are specified by a context-free grammar.
%Nowadays input data for parsing algorithms are not limited to be linear strings, and context-free grammars are used not only for programming languages specification.
%One of classical examples is a context-free path querying for graph data bases where input is a graph and path constraints are specified by a grammar.


We have some experience in graph parsing~\cite{GraphGLL, RelaxedRNGLR}.
GLL-based context-free path querying algorithm~\cite{GraphGLL} implemented by the authors is faster than solution which was presented at ISWC-2016~\cite{CFRDFParsing}. 
We have some ideas of graph parsing applications in bio data analysys.
Existing solution have problems (earley -- cycles), Metagenomic analysys -- GPGPU and manycore
