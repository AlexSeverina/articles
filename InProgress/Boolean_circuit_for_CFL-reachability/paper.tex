\begin{abstract}
The context-free language (CFL) reachability problem for a context-free grammar $G$ and directed edge-labelled graph $D$ consists of determining for every pair of nodes  $v$ and $u$ whether $v$ can reach $u$ via a path labelled by string in $L(G)$.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The context-free language (CFL) reachability problem is an important problem underlying some fundamential static code analysis \cite*{RepsBasic, Incremental} and graph database query evaluation \cite{HellingsCFPQ}\cite{RDF}\cite{GrigorevRagozina}.
\par
Unlike context-free language recognition, which is in NC, CFL-reachability is P-complete \cite{Yannakakis}\cite{RepSeq}. Practically, it means that we don't have an efficient parallel algorithm for solving this problem (unless $P \neq NC$). But want some cases... . Simple cases (examples, trees etc)... Our focus is on the...

\section{Conclusions and open problems}
Metalinear grammars used in DNA computing? --- check it.
For every algebraic number $\alpha$ bigger than 1, a Greibach language whose rational index is in $n^\alpha$ can be found \ref{}. However some context-
free languages with polynomial rational indexes are not Greibach languages \ref{}.
Add to open --- how can we describe all easy CFL? Is it possible?  Seems like not. 
\\Do only stack restictions imply easyness? (bounded stack --- regular languages).
