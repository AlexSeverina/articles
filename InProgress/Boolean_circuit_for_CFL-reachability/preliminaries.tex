\label{preliminaries}
\paragraph{Context-free languages} 
Chomsky normal form, PDA, regular languages, Greibach normal form
\\Substitution closure of a class of languages $L$ is the least class containing all substitutions of languages from $L$ to the languages from $L$.
\\Rational transduction, Generator, rational dominator
\paragraph{CFL-reachability} 
The general formulation of CFL-reachability problem can be stated as follows.
$G = (\Sigma, N, P)$ --- $G_A$ --- grammar $G$ with fixed start nonterminal $A$
\\$l(\pi)$ denotes a string which is obtained from concatenation of edge labels of the path $\pi$.
\\Connections with LGAP(L-Reachability = regular relializability = intersection of context-free language and a regular language)
\paragraph{Circuits and complexity classes} 
\paragraph{Related work}  It is well known that CFL-reachability problem is P-complete \cite{Yannakakis}.  Don't forget Wehar paper.
