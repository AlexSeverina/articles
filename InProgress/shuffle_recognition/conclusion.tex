\section{Conclusion}

We propose the way to reduce emptiness checking of intersection of shuffled CF languages with finite regular one to SAT.
We show that result formula has a special structure (huge XOR subformula) which require to use XOR-SAT-solvers.
We hope that our restriction on regular language is week enough to solve real tasks.
To prove it it is necessary to evaluate our approach on real project.

Main question for future research is decidability of emptiness of shuffled CFL and regular language intersection.
It is known that shuffled CFL is not closed under intersection with regular languages~\cite{CFLShuffle}, but decidability of intersection emptiness is looks an open question.
If it will be shown that it is undecidable in general case, then it is interesting to find subclasses for which this problem is decidable.
