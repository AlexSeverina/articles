\section{Discussion}

First of all, note that dispite in~\cite{in:2019:ECP:3327964.3328503} shows that CPU implementations (both dense and sparse matrix based) are relatively slow, our CPU implementation demonstrates good performance on real-world data.

Zeros in sparse matrices.

Overhead on matrices convertion and transferring when run on GPGPU.

No convertion when run on CPU. Beter then Neo4j and other BD with non-matrix representation of graphs.
