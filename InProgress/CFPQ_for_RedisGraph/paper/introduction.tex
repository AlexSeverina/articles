Graph data bases !!!!! 

Graph querying is !!! 
One way to formulate constrains on paths is to use formal language: concatenation of the labels along the path is treated as a word, and a specification of the language which should contain specific words is a constraint.
 Language-constrained path querying~\cite{FLCpathProblem}, 
The most popular is a regulat path querying (RPQ)~\cite{!!!}.
Context-Free Path Querying (CFPQ)~\cite{Yannakakis},  
CFPQ is widely used for graph-structured data analysis in such domains as biological data analysis, RDF, network analysis.
Huge amount of the real-world data makes performance of CFPQ critical for practical tasks.
Several algorithms for CFPQ based on such parsing techniques as (G)LL, (G)LR, and CYK are proposed recently~\cite{hellingsPathQuerying,Grigorev:2017:CPQ:3166094.3166104,Verbitskaia:2018:PCC:3241653.3241655,RDF,10.1007/978-3-319-91662-0_17,Medeiros:2018:EEC:3167132.3167265}.



Recent research shows that~\cite{Kuijpers:2019:ESC:3335783.3335791} --- all is bad, performance is poor, not applicable.

One of the most promising algorithms is a matrix-based algorithm, proposed by Rustam Azimov~\cite{Azimov:2018:CPQ:3210259.3210264}.
This algorithm offloads the most critical computations onto boolean matrices multiplication.
As a result, it is easy to implement, and allows one to utilize modern massive-parallel hardware for CFPQ.
The implementation provided by the authors utilizes GPGPU by using cuSPARSE\footnote{cuSparse is a library for sparse matrices multiplication on GPGPU. Official documentation: \url{https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusparse/index.html}. Access date: 12.11.2019} library which is a floating point sparse matrices multiplication library.
Although it does not use advanced algorithms for boolean matrices, it outperforms existing algorithms.
