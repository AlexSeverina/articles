Full integration: OpenCupher extension~\footnote{!!!}.
LibCypher~\footnote{!!!}.

GraphBlast~\cite{yang2019graphblast} --- for GPGPU.
Multi-GPU graphBlast?

Paths semantics.

Dynamically updated data. 

Another direction is the dataset improvement.
First of all, it is necessary to collect more data, and more grammars/queries.
It is of most importance to add more real-world graphs and more real-world queries to the dataset.
Secondly, it is necessary to discuss and fix the data format to be able to evaluate different algorithms.
We believe that it is necessary to create a public dataset for CFPQ algorithms evaluation, and collaboration with the community is required.
