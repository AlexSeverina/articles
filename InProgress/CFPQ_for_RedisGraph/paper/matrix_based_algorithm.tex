\section{Matrix-based Algorithm for CFPQ}

The matrix-based algorithm for CFPQ was proposed by Rustam Azimov~\cite{Azimov:2018:CPQ:3210259.3210264}.
This algorithm can be expressed in terms of operations over Boolean matrices (see listing~\ref{lst:algo1}) which is an advantage for implementation.

       {$T^{A_k}_{i,i} \gets \texttt{true}$}
    \EndFor

    \While{any matrix in $T$ is changing}
        %\Comment{Transitive closure calculation}
        \For{$A_i \to A_j A_k \in P$}
          { $T^{A_i} \gets T^{A_i} + (T^{A_j} \times T^{A_k})$ } 
        \EndFor

\EndFunction

Here $D = (V, E)$ is the input graph and $G = (N,\Sigma,P)$ is the input grammar.
For each matrix $T^{A_k}$ indexed with a nonterminal $A_k \in N$, a cell holds a true value ($T^{A_k}_{i,j} = \texttt{true}$) if and only if there exists $i \pi j$~--- a path in $D$ such that $A_k \xRightarrow[G]{*} l(\pi) $, where $l(\pi)$ is a word formed by the labels along the path $\pi$.
Thus, this algorithm solves the reachability problem, or, according to Hellings~\cite{hellingsRelational}, implements relational query semantics.

The performance-critical part of the algorithm is Boolean matrix multiplication, thus one can achieve better performance by using libraries that efficiently multiply boolean matrices. 
There is also the following optimization: if the matrices $T^{A_j}$ and $T^{A_k}$ have not changed at the previous iteration, then we can skip the update operation in line 7.
Data in real-world problems is often sparse, thus employing libraries that manipulate sparse matrices improves running time even more.
