\section{Implementation}

Previous works show~\cite{Mishin:2019:ECP:3327964.3328503, Azimov:2018:CPQ:3210259.3210264} that existing linear algebra libraries utilization is a right way to get high-performance CFPQ implementation in minimal effort.
But non of these works do not provide evaluation with data storage, only pure time of algorithm execution was mesured. 

We provide a number of implementations of matrix-based CFPQ algorithm.
All of them a based on RedisGraph~---~we use RedisGraph as a storage and implement CFPQ as an extension by using provided mechanism.
Note thet currenly we do not provide full integration with querying mechanism: one can not use Cypher, which uses in RedisGraph as a query language.
Instead, in current omplementation query provided explicetely as an file with grammar in Chomsky normal form~\cite{!!!}.
So, we can evaluate querying algorithms, but we should improve integration to make our solution applicable.
