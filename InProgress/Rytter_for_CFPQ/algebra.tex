Steps for reduction of our problem to purely algebraic problem.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Note that our graph is a Cartezian product of two graph $\mathcal{G}_H$ and $\mathcal{G}_V$ with respective adjacency matrices.
\item Adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}$ is $M(\mathcal{G}) = M(\mathcal{G}_V) \otimes I + I \otimes M(\mathcal{G}_H)$ where $I$ is identity matrix of size $n \times n$ and $\otimes$ is a Kronecker product.
\item We want to compute $\text{vec}(X)*M(\mathcal{G})^k = \text{vec}(X)*[M(\mathcal{G}_V) \otimes I + I \otimes M(\mathcal{G}_H)]^k$. Is it possible to do it in $\widetilde{O}(BMM(n))$?
\item Note that instead of $(B^T \otimes A) * \text{vec}(X) = \text{vec}(C)$ we can solve $A*X*B = C$ (one of fundamental properties of equitations with Kronecker product~\cite{schacke2004kronecker}).
The idea is to use this property.
In our case it helps to reduce multiplication of $n^2 \times n^2$ matrices to multiplication of $n \times n$ matrices.
\textbf{But} multiplication in our semiring is noncommutative.
So we need to investigate properties of Kronecker product over such semiring. 
I hope that there are relative results in algebra.
\end{enumerate}
