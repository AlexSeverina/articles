\section{Introduction}

We provide an idea of two steps reduction of CFPQs to Boolean matrix multiplication.
First step is reduction of arbitrary CFPQ to Dyck query.
Second step is adoptation Rytter's results from~\cite{Rytter} for graph.

Additionally we discuss ``fully algebraic'' view of CFPQ complexity.
