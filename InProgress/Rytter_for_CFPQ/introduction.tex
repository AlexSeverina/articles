\section{Introduction}

We provide an idea of two steps reduction of CFPQs to Boolean matrix multiplication.
First step is reduction of arbitrary CFPQ to Dyck query.
Second step is adaptation Rytter's results from~\cite{Rytter} for graph.
We hope that such reduction helps to get algorithm for CFPQ with $\widetilde{O}(BMM(n))$ time complexity where $\widetilde{O}$ meens polylog factors.

Additionally we discuss ``fully algebraic'' view on CFPQ complexity which requires investigation of noncommutative structures and matrix spaces over them.
