\section{Introduction}
Also, there are conjunctive grammars~\cite{okhotinConjAndBool}, which have more expressive power than context-free grammars. Path querying with conjunctive grammars is known to be undecidable~\cite{hellingsRelational}. Although there is an algorithm~\cite{zhang2017context} for path querying with linear conjunctive grammars~\cite{okhotinConjAndBool} which is used in static analysis and provides an over-approximation of the result. However, there is no algorithm for path querying with conjunctive grammars of an arbitrary form.

The purpose of this work is to develop an effective matrix-based algorithm
for path querying with conjunctive grammars which allows us to effectively apply GPGPU computing techniques.
