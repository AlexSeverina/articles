Future research

Formal translation of Cypher to linear algebra.
In order to formalize limits and restrictions.
There are works on a subset of SPARQL to linear algebra translation. 
But they are very limited. 
More over, it helps to improve solution.

For real-world solutions it is important to provide a unified algorithm for both RPQ and CFPQ.
A matrix-based algorithm is not a better choice.
Experiments on a unified evaluation of RPQ and CFPQ (tensors?).

Multiple-source for Neo4j (non-linear algebra based approaches evaluation).

More applications.
