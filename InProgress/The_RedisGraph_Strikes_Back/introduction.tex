\section{Introduction}

CFPQ is a way to use grammars.

CFPQ is widely spread and gain popularity.

Application for real-world data analysis is a problem.

All-pairs is a classical problem/ What about single-source?

Full-stack support of CFPQ.

The following contribution.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Single-source matrix-based CFPQ algorithm
	\item Evaluateion of thw versions of this algorithm.
	\item RedisGraph extending to provide full-stack support of CFPQ.
\end{enumerate}
