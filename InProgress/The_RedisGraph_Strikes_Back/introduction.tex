\section{Introduction}

Language-constrained path querying~\cite{doi:10.1137/S0097539798337716} is a way to find paths in edge-labeled graphs when constraints are formulated in terms of language which restrict words formed by paths: the word formed by path's labels concatenation should be in the specified language.
This way is very natural for navigational queries in graph databases, and one of the most popular languages which are used for constraints is a regular language. 
But in some cases, regular languages are not expressive enough, as a result, context-free languages gain popularity.
Constraints in the form of context-free languages, or context-free path querying (CFPQ), can be used for RDF analysis~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-46523-4_38}, biological data analysis~\cite{SubgraphQueriesbyContextfreeGrammars}, static code analysis~\cite{Zheng,10.1145/373243.360208}, and in other areas.

Big amount of research done on CFPQ, a number of CFPQ algorithms were proposed, but the application of context-free constraints for real-world data analysis faced with some problems problem.
The first problem is a bad performance of proposed algorithms on real-world data, as was shown by Jochem Kuijpers et al.~\cite{Kuijpers:2019:ESC:3335783.3335791}.
Moreover, there are no graph databases with full-stack support of CFPQ, the main effort was made in algorithms and their theoretical properties research.
This fact hinders research of problems reducible to CFPQ, thus it hinders the development of new solutions for some problems.
For example, recently graph segmentation in data provenance analysis was reduced to CFPQ~\cite{!!!}, but authors faced the problem during the evaluation of the proposed approach: no one graph database support CFPQ.

In~\cite{Azimov:2018:CPQ:3210259.3210264} Rustam Azimov propose a matrix-based algorithm for CFPQ.
This algoritm is one of promissing way to solve the first problem and provide appropriate solution for real-world data analysis, as was shown by Nikita Mishim et al. in~\cite{Mishin:2019:ECP:3327964.3328503} and Arseniy Terekhov et al. in~\cite{10.1145/3398682.3399163}. 
But this algorithm always computes information (reachability facts or single path which satisfies constraints) for all pairs of vertices in the graph.
It is unreasonable for some real-world scenarios when one can provide a relatively small set of start vertices or even single start vertex. 

While all-pairs context-free path querying is a classical problem that investigates in a number of works, there is no, in our knowledge, solutions for single-source and multiple-source CFPQ.
In this work we propose a matrix-based multiple-source (and single source as a partial case) CFPQ algorithm.

Also, we provide full-stack support of CFPQ for the RedisGraph\footnote{!!!}~\cite{!!!} graph database.
We implement a Cypher query language extension\footnote{!!!} that allows one to express context-free constraints, and extend the RedisGraph to support this extension.
In our knowledge, it is the first full-stack implementation of CFPQ.

To sommarize, we make the following contribution in this paper.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Multiple-source matrix-based CFPQ algorithm. 
	Single-source as a partial case.
	\item Evaluateion of two versions of this algorithm.
	\item RedisGraph extending to provide full-stack support of CFPQ.
\end{enumerate}
