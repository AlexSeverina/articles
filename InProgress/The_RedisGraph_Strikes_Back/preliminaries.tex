\section{Preliminaries}

In this section we introduce common definitions in graph theory and formal language theory which will be used in this paper. 
Also, we provide brief description of Azimov's algorithm which will be used as a base of our solution.

\subsection{Graphs}

Labelled digraph, matrices, ...
\begin{definition}
Digraph
\end{definition}

\subsection{Languages}

Grammars, normal forms, ...
\begin{definition}
Digraph
\end{definition}


\subsection{Matrix-Based Algorithm}

Description

Pseudocode.

What about arbitrary (not CNF) CFG?
