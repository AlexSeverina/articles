 abstract="Recursive state machines (RSMs) enhance the power of ordinary state machines by allowing vertices to correspond 
 either to ordinary states or to potentially recursive invocations of other state machines. RSMs can model the control 
 flow in sequential imperative programs containing recursive procedure calls. They can be viewed as a visual notation 
 extending Statecharts-like hierarchical state machines, where concurrency is disallowed but recursion is allowed. 
 They are also related to various models of pushdown systems studied in the verification and program analysis communities.",
