\section{Introduction}

CFPQ is popular and widely used for !!!.

Matrices~\cite{Azimov:2018:CPQ:3210259.3210264} --- algorithm is fast, but grammar size is problem.

Moreover, bad for regualr queryes.

In adition, Kuipers says that existing algorithms are not applicable for real-world problems. So we should develop new ones.

Following contribution.
\begin{enumerate}
\item New algorithm is proposed. Recursive automata intersection. Applicable for regular queryes. Linear algebra.
\item Example is provided.
\item Evaluation is prvided.
\end{enumerate}
