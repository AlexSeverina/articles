\section{Introduction}

CFPQ is popular and widely used for !!!.

Matrices~\cite{Azimov:2018:CPQ:3210259.3210264} --- algorithm is fast, but grammar size is problem.

Moreover, bad for regualr queryes.

In adition, Kuipers says that existing algorithms are not applicable for real-world problems. So we should develop new ones.

The result of context-free querying evaluation is ... . It follows \textit{relational query semantics} \cite{Hellings2014ConjunctiveCP}.

Main contribution of this paper could be summarised as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We introduce an algorithm, applicable for both context-free and regular queries, which is based on recursive state machines intersection, Kronecker product and transitive closure evaluation.
\item We provide an example of the algorithm computation with step-by-step solution.
\item We provide an evaluation results of the algorithm implementation and its comparison with matrix based algorithm. 
\end{enumerate}
