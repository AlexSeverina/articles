abstract="We present a technique for syntax analysis of a regular set of input strings. This problem is relevant for the analysis of string-embedded languages when a host program generates clauses of embedded language at run time. Our technique is based on a generalization of RNGLR algorithm, which, inherently, allows us to construct a finite representation of parse forest for regularly approximated set of input strings. This representation can be further utilized for semantic analysis and transformations in the context of reengineering, code maintenance, program understanding etc. The approach in question implements relaxed parsing: non-recognized strings in approximation set are ignored with no error detection.",

abstract = "We present a method based on top-down parsing techniques for evaluating context-free path queries on RDF Graph Databases. The syntax of the query language is based on SPARQL. The language extends SPARQL by allowing the use of non-terminal symbols of a context-free grammar to specify paths on the graph. In this manner, the language subsumes the definition of regular graph patterns present in SPARQL. Our query evaluator takes an RDF graph, a context-free grammar and a declarative query, and produces tuples of values. The query evaluator proceeds in two stages: Firstly, the RDF graph is enriched with edges representing paths which correspond to strings derived by the grammar. We show that this algorithm is correct and presents a cubic worst-case run-time complexity on the number of nodes in the graph, which is an improvement over some previous work. The second stage of the evaluator uses the produced graph to identify tuples of values defined by a declarative query. In order to validate our approach, we conducted experiments by using some popular ontologies as well as synthetic databases. We compare performance results of our method with some related work."

abstract="Many computing applications require processing of data that are directly collected from the Internet. In this context, the use of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) has became a common feature. The query and analysis of RDF data is paramount to explore the full potential of the data available on the Web. Query languages for RDF graph databases rely on the use of regular expressions to identify paths over the data. Some interesting queries, such as same-generation queries, cannot be expressed by regular expressions. We are interested in extending the expressiveness of queries over graph databases by using paths defined by context-free grammars. We introduce a new query algorithm to process context-free path queries over graph databases. Our approach is inspired by the LR(1) parsing techniques. A prototype was implemented and experiments were conducted to validate and compare the results of our algorithm with those obtained by similar approaches.",

abstract="Navigational graph queries are an important class of queries that can extract implicit binary relations over the nodes of input graphs. Most of the navigational query languages used in the RDF community, e.g. property paths in W3C SPARQL 1.1 and nested regular expressions in nSPARQL, are based on the regular expressions. It is known that regular expressions have limited expressivity; for instance, some natural queries, like same generation-queries, are not expressible with regular expressions. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present cfSPARQL, an extension of SPARQL query language equipped with context-free grammars. The cfSPARQL language is strictly more expressive than property paths and nested expressions. The additional expressivity can be used for modelling graph similarities, graph summarization and ontology alignment. Despite the increasing expressivity, we show that cfSPARQL still enjoys a low computational complexity and can be evaluated efficiently.",
