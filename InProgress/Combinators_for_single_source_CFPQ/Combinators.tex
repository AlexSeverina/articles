\section{Combinators for Context-Free Path Querying}

In this section we demonstrate main features of combinators in the context of context-free path querying and integration with general-purpose programming languages.
To do it we sove the problem which we state in the previous section.


\subsection{Compositionality}

same generation query

\subsection{Type Safety}

Static type chacking

\subsection{User-Defined Actions}

Additional computations

\subsection{IDE Support}

Screens!!!!
