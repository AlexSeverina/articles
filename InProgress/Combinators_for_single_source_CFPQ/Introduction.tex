\section{Introduction}

Context-Free path querying (CFPQ) is an actively developed area in graph datatbase analysis.

CFPQ is widely used for static code analysis.

Languages for language-constrained queryes specification.
CfSparql and proposal for Cypher.

Integration with general purpose programming language. Typing~\cite{10.1145/2076623.2076653}.

Combinators~\cite{10.1145/3241653.3241655}.

Single source scenario.
Instead of traditional all pairs.
Some of algorithms inheritantly calculate only all pairs reachability. 

In this paper we make the following contributions.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce example and explain how to use combinators for CFPQ.
  \item Evaluate single source. We explore some basic properties of real-world dataset, such as lengths of paths and number of reachable vertices.
\end{itemize}
