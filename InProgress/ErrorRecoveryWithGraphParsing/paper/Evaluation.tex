\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We implement proposed algortihm as a modification of solution which is proposed in~\cite{!!!}.

The goal of evaluation is to compare performance of GLL and GLL with error recovery.

Simple arithmetic expressions.

Grammar.

Input generation. Without tokenezation.

Timing. Original GLL. GLL with error recovery.

Cases: without errors, error in the end of file, in the middle, abd in the start, several errors.
