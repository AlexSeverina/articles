\section{Error Recovery Algorithm}



Additional edges with error markers goes forward and with all tokens, goes in the its start vertex 
(as a result we have loops).
Number of edges may be optimized by filtering with FIRST/REST and other functions

Priority queue for descriptors. 
Priority is a number of additional edges (not from the original input) in processed prefix.
