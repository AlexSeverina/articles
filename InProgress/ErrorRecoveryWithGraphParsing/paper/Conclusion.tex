\section{Duscussion and Conclusion}

We propose a way to reduce error recovery problem to a special case of context-free reachability problem.
This way we demonstrate deep interconnection betwee these two problems.

We provide the algorithm and its implementation witin evaluation on some preliminary data.
We show that !!!!

Future research includes both theoretical and paractical parts.
In the practical way we should provide high-quolity implementation of proposed algorithm, and evaluate it on well-known datasets.
For example, on data from the BlackBox project~\cite{!!!}.
Also we should compare our results with other similar solutions such as~\cite{!!!} and~\cite{!!!}.

In theory we should find interconnections between CFL reachability, CFPQ, CFL editing distance end error recovery in order to unify methods and share ideas and solutions.
