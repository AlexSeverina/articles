\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose a native way to integrate a language for context-free path querying into a general-purpose programming language.
Our solution handles arbitrary context-free grammars and arbitrary input graphs.
The proposed approach is language-independent and may be implemented in nearly every general-purpose programming language.
We implement it in Scala as a modification to the parser combinator library Meerkat and show that our approach can be applied to the real world problems.

We can propose some possible directions for the future work.
In order to improve the performance and investigate the scalability of the solution, we plan to implement a parallel single machine and distributed GLL.
It is a challenge from both the theoretical and the practical standpoint.

Some important problems in the realm of the static code analysis cannot be expressed in terms of context-free path querying.
For example, the context-sensitive data-dependence analysis may be precisely expressed in terms of the linear-conjunctive language~\cite{Okhotin2003LCL} reachability but not context-free~\cite{LCLReachability}.
How to support the arbitrary conjunctive grammars is also worth research.
This technique can be employed as a static analysis framework.
