\section{Parser Combinators for Path Querying}
\label{sec:combinators}

Parser combinators are a way to specify both a language syntax and a parser for it in terms of higher-order functions.
A parser in this framework is a function which consumes a prefix of input and returns either a parsing result or an error if the~input is erroneous.
Parser combinators compose parsers to form more complex parsers.
A parser combinators library usually provides a set of basic parser combinators, such as a combinator of the~sequential application or the~choice combinator, but there can also be user-defined combinators.
Most parser combinators libraries, including the~Meerkat library, can only process the~linear input---strings or streams.
We modify the~Meerkat library to work on the~graph input. The~following ideas are at the~core of the~modification.

The~intersection of a context-free and a regular language is context-free. There are several constructive proofs of this fact.
The~proposed solution is yet another constructive proof with the~SPPF as a user-friendly representation of the~context-free grammar for the~intersection.

Linear input can be regarded as a linear directed graph with symbols of the~input labelling the~edges.
A conventional parser moves a pointer in the~input from the~position $i$ to the~position $i+1$ and creates a new state when a token between the~$i$-th and the~$i+1$-th positions matches what is required in the~grammar.
In case of graph processing, there are possibly multiple ways to move from the~current vertex $i$, and it is possible to produce multiple new states.
Generalized parsing is designed to handle the~production of multiple new states optimally, thus it is suitable to handle graph processing.

Matching a token in the~input can be viewed as a predicate, for example, $p_c (x) = x == c$.
We can generalize this observation allowing matching of an edge label of an arbitrary type with a predicate of some sort.
If vertices of the~graph contain any data of interest, we can treat them in the~similar fashion as the~edges.
The~formal definition of the~context-free language constrained path querying changes only in a way a string is collected along a path in the~input graph: the~data stored in the~vertices should also be taken into consideration.

Handling cycles in the~input graphs imposes two challenges: not to get stuck in an infinite loop while processing the~positions and if a new parsing state appears at some position, all paths which pass through this state, should be accounted for.
The~Meerkat memoization routine solves both of these challenges.
Parsing from a parser state at each position is only run if it has never been run before, so since there is only a finite number of parsing states and positions in the~input, parsing terminates.
Appearing of the~new parsing state at a position which has been processed before triggers processing of every path possibly affected by it.
Thanks to the~memoization, each derivation of each subpath is analyzed only once, so there is no significant overhead at re-running.


Querying process in our library is inherited from generalized parsing and is done in two steps.
The~first step is ``parsing'': the~construction of the~SPPF which contains all derivation trees for the~paths satisfying syntactic constraints.
The~second step is semantic actions application which retrieves the~necessary additional data about the~paths from the~SPPF.

\subsection{The~Set of Combinators}

In this section, we demonstrate the~set of combinators by example. The~input graph, which represents a map, is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:graph}.
In the input graph, there are some cities connected by one-way roads depicted by the~edges labelled $road\_to$.
Each city is labelled by its name and a country it belongs to.

\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=2cm,on grid,auto]
   \node[state] (a) [fill={rgb:black,1;white,2}]  {$a(X)$};
   \node[state] (b) [right=of a] {$b (Y)$};
   \node[state] (c) [right=of b] {$c (X)$};
   \node[state] (d) [left=of a] {$d (Y)$};
   \node[state] (e) [left=of d] {$e (X)$};
    \path[->]
    (a) edge [bend left, above] node [above] {$road\_to$} (c)
    (b) edge  node {$road\_to$} (a)
    (c) edge  node {$road\_to$} (b)
    (a) edge  node {$road\_to$} (d)
    (d) edge  node {$road\_to$} (e);
\end{tikzpicture}
}

\label{fig:graph}
\end{figure}

Two basic building blocks of queries are the~combinators for dealing with edges and vertices.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \lstinline{V[N](predicate: N => Boolean)} the~combinator for processing vertices, where \lstinline{N} is a type of the~node label.
    Parsing with this combinator succeeds iff the~vertex satisfies the~predicate.
    \item \lstinline{E[L](predicate: L => Boolean)} the~combinator for processing edges, where \lstinline{L} is a type of the~edge label.
    Parsing with this combinator succeeds iff the~edge satisfies the~predicate.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{sppf}
\caption{SPPF: result of applying cities query to the~graph~\ref{fig:graph}}
\label{fig:sppf}
\end{figure}

To select cities which belong to some country, we can use the~function \lstinline{V}: \lstinline{V[N]((e: Entity) => e.country = "County Name")}.
Here \lstinline{Entity} is a property container for both edges and vertices.
By using the~\lstinline{Dynamic} trait, all accesses to properties (like \lstinline{(e: Entity).country}) are converted to the~accesses to the~properties of either a vertex or an edge.
For the~sake of simplicity, we will omit \lstinline{Entity} type specifications for predicates.
To query the~graph for the~paths from a city in the~country $X$ to a city in the~country $Y$, we need to sequentially compose the~combinators for selecting the~appropriate cities.
A sequential combinator \lstinline{~} does just that: it sequentially  applies two queries one after the~other.
Let us denote a query for retrieving a city from the~specific country \lstinline{city(name: String)} and a query for retrieving road edges \lstinline{roadTo}.
With this denotation, a query \lstinline{city("X") ~ roadTo ~ city("Y")} returns the~requested set of paths from the~graph.
The~query with all necessary subqueries is the~following\footnote{Underscore in anonymous lambda functions serves as a placeholder for an argument: \lstinline{(_.country == country)} is equavalent to \lstinline{(x => x.country == country)} }.

\begin{lstlisting}
def city(country: String) = V(_.country == country)
val roadTo = E(_.value() == "road_to")
val ourPath = city("X") ~ roadTo ~ city("Y")
\end{lstlisting}

The~next step after writing the~query is to implement a function to retrieve the~actual data about the~paths.
If we care only about the~names of the~cities, we can return a pair of the~cities for each path.
First, we modify the~query for vertices by adding the~semantic action to it using the~combinator \lstinline{^}:

\begin{lstlisting}
def city(name: String) =
  syn(V(e.value() == name) ^ (_.value))}
\end{lstlisting}

Then we need to map a path to a pair of cities: this is done with the~combinator \lstinline{&}.
The~complete query retuns the~sequence of pairs of cities which have the~road between them:

\begin{lstlisting}
def city(country: String) =
  syn(V(_.country() == country) ^ (_.name))
val roadTo = E(_.value() == "road_to")
val ourPath =
  syn(city("X") ~ roadTo ~ city("Y") &
    { case c0 ~ c1 => (c0, c1) })
\end{lstlisting}

The~whole set of basic combinators, which our library provides, is presented in Table~\ref{table:combinators}.
There are two kinds of combinators: the~first kind combines parsers to form new parsers; meanwhile the~second one is dedicated to the~processing of the~query result.
Whenever a string is used within a query, a parser which matches that string is generated implicitly.

{\lstinline!a & f!} & apply {\lstinline!f!} function to {\lstinline!a!} if  {\lstinline!a!} is a parser \\
{\lstinline!a &&!}  & capture output of {\lstinline!a!} if {\lstinline!a!} is a parser    \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Generic Interface for Input}
The~combinators in our library are independent of the~input representation.
It is enough to specify two basic combinators which handle vertices and edges.
Vertex handling is checking whether the~vertex satisfies the~given predicate.
In case of the~edges, one needs to check which of the~edges outgoing from the~given vertex satisfy the~given predicate.
These two functions form the~trait for the~input (Fig.~\ref{fig:input}).
It has two type parameters: the~type of edge labels \lstinline{L} and the~type of vertices labels \lstinline{N}.
Since the~required functions are simple, we believe it is possible to support most storages of graph-structured data.
We supported several different input sources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Neo4jInput: input source for the~graph database Neo4j;
    \item GraphxInput: input source for the~graph presented in memory using the~GraphX library;
    \item LinearInput: input source for the~linear input data such as the~ordinary strings.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{lstlisting}
trait Input[+L, +N] {
  def filterEdges(nodeId: Int,
      predicate: L => Boolean): Seq[(L, Int)]
  def checkNode(nodeId: Int,
      predicate: N => Boolean): Option[N] }
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Generalized input interface}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Semantic Actions}
\label{sec:semanticActions}

Every path, which the~query produces, has a derivation tree stored in the~SPPF.
The~derivation tree is a very rich data structure which can be hard to understand.
The~library provides a mechanism of semantic actions to retrieve the~data useful for the~user.
It is a way to apply some function to a parsed token or a subsequence.

Semantic action binder for the~tokens---vertices and edges alike---is \lstinline{^}. The~most common use for it is to extract properties from the~token and combine them in some fashion.

\begin{lstlisting}
// Defined in Terminal[+L] (edge) parser
def ^[U](f: L => U) =
  new SymbolWithAction[L, Nothing, U] {...

// Defined in Vertex[+N] parser
def ^[U](f: N => U) =
  new SymbolWithAction[Nothing, N, U] {...
\end{lstlisting}

For the~combination of parsers there is a \lstinline{&} binder. Being  applied to a sequence of tokens, it can collect and process the~data returned by the~terminal parsers.

\begin{lstlisting}
// Defined in Symbol[+L, +N, +V] parser
def &[U](f: V => U) =
  new SymbolWithAction[L, N, U] {...
\end{lstlisting}

They both produce a new parser that parses the~input exactly like the~given parser but also have a bound function.
The~function is referenced in each SPPF node created by the~corresponding parser.

The~way semantic actions are executed has mostly remained the~same as in the~original Meerkat library: semantic actions are first executed for the~children of the~current node, then the~results are collected and passed to a semantic action of the~current node.
If there are ambiguous nodes in the~SPPF, the~original Meerkat library just throws an exception.
In our case, ambiguity can arise not only when there are multiple derivations of a string, but ambiguous nodes can also represent several different subpaths which are derived from the~corresponding nonterminal.
We chose to provide a way to extract the~derivation trees from the~SPPF lazily since the~number of the~paths can be infinite.
Unambiguous trees are yielded with a breadth-first search.

The~composition of the~extraction of trees and the~semantic action execution is called \lstinline{executeQuery}.
It parses the~input graph from all positions, produces a list of SPPF roots, extracts all derivations from every root, executes semantic actions and returns a lazy stream of results.
