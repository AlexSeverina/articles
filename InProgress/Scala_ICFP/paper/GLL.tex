handle arbitrary context-free grammar, cubic time complexity.

GLL-based combinators.

Meerkat library is a general parser combinators library; by using memoization, continuation-passing style and the ideas of Johnson~\cite{Johnson}, it supports arbitrary context-free specifications. 


\subsection{SPPF}

Structural representation. 
Derevation tree.
Forest for unambiguous grammars.
For graph too.
Shared Packed Oarse Forest (SPPF)~\cite{SPPF} structure, description, usability for CFPQ.

Binarized Shared Packed Parse Forest (SPPF)~\cite{brnglr} compresses derivation trees optimally reusing common nodes and subtrees.
Version of GLL which utilizes this structure for parsing forest representation achieves worst-case cubic space complexity~\cite{gllParsingTree}.

Binarized SPPF can be represented as a graph in which each node has one of four types described below.
We denote the start and the end positions of substring as $i$ and $j$ respectively, and we call tuple $(i,j)$ an \textit{extension} of a node.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Terminal node} with label $(i, T, j)$.
    \item \textbf{Nonterminal node} with label $(i, N, j)$. 
    This node denotes that there is at least one derivation for substring $\alpha=\omega[i..j-1]$ such that $N \Rightarrow^*_G \alpha, \alpha = \omega[i..j-1] $.
    All derivation trees for the given substring and nonterminal can be extracted from SPPF by left-to-right top-down graph traversal started from respective node.     
    \item \textbf{Intermediate node}: a special kind of node used for binarization of SPPF. These nodes are labeled with $(i,t,j)$, where $t$ is a grammar slot.
    \item \textbf{Packed node} with label $(N \rightarrow \alpha, k)$. 
    Subgraph with ``root'' in such node is one possible derivation from nonterminal $N$ in case when the parent is a nonterminal node labeled with $(<\mkern-9mu | \mkern-9mu> (i, N, j))$.

\end{itemize}

An example of SPPF is presented in figure~\ref{SPPF}. We remove redundant intermediate and packed nodes from the SPPF to simplify it and to decrease the size of the structure.



\subsection{GLL for CFPQ}

Our work~\cite{GrigorevR16}. 
It is possible to use GLL for CFPQ.
String-embedded querying is a ugly solution. 

As the Meerkat library is closely related to the Generalized LL algorithm and since GLL can be generalized for context-free path querying~\cite{GrigorevR16}, it is also possible to adapt Meerkat library for graph querying. 
It can be done by providing a function for retrieving the symbols which follow the specified position and utilizing it in the basic set of combinators.
Detail described below.
