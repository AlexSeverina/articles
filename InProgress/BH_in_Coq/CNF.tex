\section{The Chomsky Normal Form}

One of important part of our proof is the fact that any context-free language can be described with grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) or, equally, any context-free grammar can be converted in grammar in CNF which specifies the same language.
Let us remind the definition of CNF and main steps of algorithm for CFG to CNF conversion.
\definition[Chomsky Normal Form]{Let define that context-free grammar is in CNF if:
\begin{itemize}
\item start nonterminal is not occurs in right side of rules,
\item all rules have one of the next form: $N_i \rightarrow t_i$, $N_i \rightarrow N_j N_k$ or $S \rightarrow \varepsilon$ where $N_i,N_j,N_k$ are nonterminals, $t_i$ is terminal and $S$ is start nonterminal.
\end{itemize} }

Steps of transformation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Eliminate the start symbol from right-hand sides of rules.
\item Eliminate rules with nonsolary terminals
\item Eliminate rules which right-hand side contains more than two nonterminals
\item Delete $\varepsilon$-rules.
\item Eliminate unit rules.
\end{enumerate}

As far as Bar-Hillel theorem operates with arbitrary context-free languages but proof requires grammar CNF, it is necessary to create certified algorithm for arbitrary CFG to CNF conversion.
We want to reuse existing proof of conversion of arbitrary context-free grammar to CNF.
We choose Smolka's version which contains proof for conversion to CNF in the next form.
