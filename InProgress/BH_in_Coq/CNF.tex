\section{The Chomsky Normal Form}
\label{sec:cnf}

The important part of our proof is that any context-free language can be described with grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) or, equally, any context-free grammar can be converted to the grammar in CNF which specifies the same language.
Let us recall the definition of CNF and the algorithm for arbitary cotex-free (CF) grammar to CNF conversion.
\definition[Chomsky Normal Form]{Context-free grammar is in CNF if:
\begin{itemize}
\item start nonterminal does not occur in the right-hand side of rules,
\item all rules are of the form: $N_i \rightarrow t_i$, $N_i \rightarrow N_j N_k$ or $S \rightarrow \varepsilon$ where $N_i,N_j,N_k$ are nonterminals, $t_i$ is a terminal and $S$ is the start nonterminal.
\end{itemize} }

Transformation algorithm has the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Eliminate the start symbol from the right-hand sides of the rules.
\item Eliminate rules with nonsolary terminals.
\item Eliminate rules which right-hand side contains more than two nonterminals.
\item Delete $\varepsilon$-rules.
\item Eliminate unit rules.
\end{enumerate}

As far as Bar-Hillel theorem operates with arbitrary context-free languages, but the selected proof requires grammar in CNF, it is necessary to implement a certified algorithm for conversion of arbitrary CF grammar to CNF.
We wanted to reuse existing mechanized proof of conversion of arbitrary context-free grammar to CNF.
We choose one provided in Smolka's work and discussed in context of our work in the section~\ref{sec:solka-generalized}.
