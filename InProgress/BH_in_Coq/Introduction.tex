\section{Introduction}

Language intersection problem is a foundation in many areas.
It is the well-knon fact tat context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. 
Theoretical result is Bar-Hillel~\cite{bar1961formal} theorem which provide construction for resulting langugae description.
Foundation in some areas: graphs, code analysis, etc.

Bar-Hillel theorem is a main on .

Mechanization (formalization) is important and many work done on formal languages theory mechanization.

Short overview of current results.

The main contribution of this paper mai be summarized as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item We Bar-Hillel theorem in Coq.
\item We generalize Smolka's CFL results: terminals is abstract types....
\item ...
\end{itemize}
