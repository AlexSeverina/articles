\section{Conclusion}

Short resume of main part (main results formulation).
We present mechanization of Bar-Hillel theorem on closure of contex-free languages under intersection with regular.

Other algorithms on regular and context-free languages intersection.
One of direction of future reserch is mechanization of practical algorithms which are just implementation of Bar-Hillel theorem.
For example, context-free path querying algorithm, based on GLL~\cite{scott2010gll} parsing algorithm~\cite{grigorev2016context}.

Other problems on language intersection~\cite{nederhof2002parsing, nederhof2004language}.
