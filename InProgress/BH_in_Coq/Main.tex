\section{B-H in Coq}
Main part. 
All code are published on GitHub~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/YaccConstructor/YC\_in\_Coq}}
What did you do and how. And, possible, why. Problems, nontrivial solutions, stc.
    
\subsection{ Smolka's code generalization}

First we nwwd to generalize code of ...

\subsection{General scheme of proof}

General scheme of our proof is based on constructive proof presented by~\cite{!!!}

\subsection{Part one: regular language and automata}

First step is !!!!

\subsection{Part two}

\subsection{ Part N: final step}

Finally we should proof main statement!
