\section{Bar-Hillel Theorem}
\label{sec:b-h-th}

In this section we provide the Bar-Hillel theorem and sketch the proof which we use as base of our work.
Also we provide some additional lemmas which are used in the proof of the main theorem.

\begin{lemma} \label{l1}
	If $L$ is a context free language and $\varepsilon \notin L$ then there is a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form that generates $L$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma} \label{l2}
	If $ L \neq \varnothing $ and $L$ is regular then $L$ is the union of regular language $A_1, \ldots , A_n$ where each $A_i$ is accepted by a DFA with exactly one final state.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Bar-Hillel Theorem]
	If $L_1$ is a context free language and $L_2$ is a regular language then $L_1 \cap L_2$ is context free.
\end{theorem}


Sketch of the proof.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item By lemma~\ref{l1} we can assume that there is a context-free grammar $G_{CNF}$ in Chomsky normal form, such that $L(G_{CNF}) = L_1$
	\item By lemma~\ref{l2} we can assume that there is a set of regular languages $\{A_{1} \ldots A_n \}$ where each $A_i$ is recognized by a DFA with exactly one final state and $L_2 = A_1 \cup \ldots \cup A_n$
	\item For each $A_i$ we can explicitly define a grammar of the intersection: $L( G_{CNF} ) \cap A_i$
	\item Finally, we join them together with the operation of union
\end{enumerate}
