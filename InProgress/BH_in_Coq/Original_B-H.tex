\section{Bar-Hillel Theorem}

Original B-H theorem and proof which we use as base.
We work with the next formulation of the theorem.

\begin{lemma}\label{l1}
If $L$ is a context free language and $\varepsilon \notin L$ then there is grammar in Chomsky Normal Form that generates $L$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{l2}
If $L \neq \varnothing $ and $L$ is regular then $L$ is the union of regular language $A_1, \ldots , A_n$ where each $A_i$ is accepted by a DFA with exactly one final state.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
If $L_1$ is a context free language and $L_2$ is a regular language then $L_1 \cap L_2$ is context
free.

\end{theorem}

Sketch of proof:
\begin{enumerate}
\item By lemma~\ref{l1} we can assume that there is a context-free grammar $G$ in Chomsky normal form, such that $L(G) = L_1$
\item  
\item 
\item
\end{enumerate}
