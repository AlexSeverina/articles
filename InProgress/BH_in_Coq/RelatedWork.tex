\section{Related Works}

There is a big number of works in mechanization of different parts of formal languages theory and certified implementations of parsing algorithms and algorithms for graph data base querying. These works use different tools, such s Coq, Agda, HOL 4, and aimed to different problems such as theory mechanisation or executable algorithm certification.

Regular and Context-free in Coq by Smolka et al~\cite{smolka2017regular, smolka2013regular}.

Huge work was done by Denis Firsov who implement in Agda many parts of formal language theory and parsing algorithms: CYK~\cite{!!!}, Chomsky Normal Form~\cite{!!!}, etc~\cite{firsov2016cfl}.

Certified parsers parser generators.

Number of works by !!! 

In HOL4.

Certified prolog querying in Coq~\cite{certifiedPrologGraphQuerying}
