\section{Related Works}

There is a big number of works in mechanization of different parts of formal languages theory and certified implementations of parsing algorithms and algorithms for graph data base querying.
These works use different tools, such s Coq, Agda, Isabelle/HOL, and aimed to different problems such as theory mechanization or executable algorithm certification.
We discuss only small part which is close enough to the scope of this work.

Huge amount of work was done by Ruy de Queiroz who formalize different parts of formal language theory, such as pumping lemma~\cite{ramos2015formalizationPumping}, context-free grammar simplification~\cite{ramos2015formalization} and closure properties (union, Klenee star, but without intersection with regular language)~\cite{ramos2015formalizationClosure} in Coq.
All these results are summarized in~\cite{ramos2016formalization}. 

Another part of formal languages formalization in Coq by Gert Smolka et.al.~\cite{smolka2017regular, smolka2013regular}.
Regular and Context-Free languages.

Also exist some works by Denis Firsov who implements in Agda some parts of formal language theory and parsing algorithms: CYK~\cite{firsov2014certified}, Chomsky Normal Form~\cite{firsov2015certified}, etc~\cite{firsov2016cfl}.

Certified parsers and parser generators.

In HOL4.

In the graph database area there exist work on certified Regular Datalog querying in Coq~\cite{certifiedPrologGraphQuerying}. 
This work is inspiration for certified CFPQs.
