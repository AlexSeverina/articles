\section{Related Work}

There is a big number of works in mechanization of different parts of formal languages theory and certified implementation of parsing algorithms and algorithms for graph data base querying.

Regular and Context-free by Smolka et al~\cite{smolka2017regular, smolka2013regular}. 

Huge work was done by Denis Firsov who implement in Agda many parts of formal language theory and parsing algorithm: CYK~\cite{!!!}, Chomsky Normal Form~\cite{!!!}, etc~\cite{firsov2016cfl}.

Certified parsers.

In HOL4.

Certified prolog querying~\cite{certifiedPrologGraphQuerying}
