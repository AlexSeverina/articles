\section{Related Works}

There is a big number of works in mechanization of different parts of formal languages theory and certified implementations of parsing algorithms and algorithms for graph data base querying. These works use different tools, such s Coq, Agda, Isabelle/HOL, and aimed to different problems such as theory mechanisation or executable algorithm certification.

Huge work was done by Ruy de Queiroz who formalize diferent parts of formal languge theory, such as puping lemma~\cite{ramos2015formalization}, context-free grammar simplification~\cite{ramos2015formalization} and closure properties~\cite{ramos2015formalizationClosure} in Coq.
All these results are summarized in~\cite{ramos2016formalization}. 

Anoter part of formal languages formalization in Coq by Gert Smolka et.al.~\cite{smolka2017regular, smolka2013regular}.

Also exist som works by Denis Firsov who implement in Agda many parts of formal language theory and parsing algorithms: CYK~\cite{firsov2014certified}, Chomsky Normal Form~\cite{firsov2015certified}, etc~\cite{firsov2016cfl}.
