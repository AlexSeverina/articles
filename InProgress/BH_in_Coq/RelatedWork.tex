\section{Related Works}

There is a big number of works in mechanization of different parts of formal languages theory and certified implementations of parsing algorithms and algorithms for graph data base querying.
These works use different tools, such s Coq, Agda, Isabelle/HOL, and aimed to different problems such as theory mechanization or executable algorithm certification.
We discuss only small part which is close enough to the scope of this work.

\subsection{Formal Language Theory in Coq}
Huge amount of work was done by Ruy de Queiroz who formalize different parts of formal language theory, such as pumping lemma~\cite{ramos2015formalizationPumping}, context-free grammar simplification~\cite{ramos2015formalization} and closure properties~\cite{ramos2015formalizationClosure} in Coq.
The work on closure properties contains mechanization of such properties as closure under union, Klenee star, but it does not contains mechanization of intersection with regular language.
All these results are summarized in~\cite{ramos2016formalization}. 

Another attempt of formal languages formalization in Coq is results of Gert Smolka et.al.~\cite{smolka2017regular,smolka2013regular, }.
Regular and Context-Free languages. 
Certified transformation to Chomsky normal form which is required for BH. 
Initially we hope to use these both parts because Bar-Hillel theorem is about both context-free and regular languages, and it was the reason to choose results of Gert Smolka as base for our work.
But PROBLEMS with reusing and integration and in current proof we use only results on context-free languages!

Regular language mechanization and certification.

\subsection{Formal Language Theory in Other Languages}

Also exist some works by Denis Firsov who implements in Agda some parts of formal language theory and parsing algorithms: CYK~\cite{firsov2014certified}, Chomsky Normal Form~\cite{firsov2015certified}, etc~\cite{firsov2016cfl}.
And on regular languages~\cite{10.1007/978-3-319-03545-1_7}.

Formal language theory mechanization in Isabelle~\cite{1885-16399}.
Basic definitions and big number of theoretical results. 
As an application --- SLR certification.

\subsection{Certified Algorithms}

Certified algorithms are required in different areas for various reasons.

For example Path querying in structured data (graphs, XML).

Core of XQuery~\cite{10.1007/978-3-642-25379-9_21} --- W3C standard for path querying in XML, extended for graph querying.

In the graph database area there exist work on certified Regular Datalog querying in Coq~\cite{certifiedPrologGraphQuerying}. 
Our work may be a base for certified context-free path querying algorithm.

Certified parsers and parser generators as yet another algorithms on formal languages.
