These results often rely on RNA secondary structure predictions. However, current approaches to RNA secondary structure modelling produce predictions with a high variance in predictive accuracy, and we have little quantifiable knowledge about the reasons for these variances.",

	title="Self-embedded context-free grammars with regular counterparts",
	journal="Acta Informatica",

	volume="40",

	pages="349--365",
	abstract="In general, it is undecidable if an arbitrary context-free grammar has a regular solution. Past work has focused on special cases, such as one-letter grammars, non self-embedded grammars and the finite-language grammars, for which regular counterparts have been proven to exist. However, little is known about grammars with the self-embedded property. Using systems of equations, we highlight a number of subclasses of grammars, with self-embeddedness terms, such as                                                                           {\$}X {\backslash}alpha X{\$}                 and                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}gamma X {\backslash}gamma{\$}                , that can still have regular languages as solutions. Constructive proofs that allow these subclasses of context-free grammars to be transformed to regular expressions are provided. We also point out a subclass of context-free grammars that is inherently non-regular. Our latest results can help demarcate more precisely the known boundaries between the regular and non-regular languages, within the context-free domain.",
