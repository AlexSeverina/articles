\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We propose GLL-based algorithm for context-free path querying which constructs finite structural representation of all paths satisfying given constraint.
Provided data structure can be useful for result investigation and processing as well as for query debugging.
Presented algorithm has been implemented in F\# programming language~\cite{FSharp} and is available on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/YaccConstructor/YaccConstructor}.

We are working on improving performance by means of implementation of recently proposed modifications for the original GLL algorithm~\cite{FGLL,FastPracticalGLL}.
Future direction of our research is a generalization of grammar factorization proposed in~\cite{FGLL} which may be practical for processing of regular queries which are common in real world applications.
