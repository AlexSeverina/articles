\section{An Example}\label{motivExample}

In this section we demonstrate our algorithm on a small problem.
The query used in our example may seem too primitive, but keep in mind that it is a classical context-free \textit{same-generation queries}~\cite{FndDB}, which is base for other context-free queries~\cite{GraphQueryWithEarley}.

Suppose that you are a student in School of Magic.
It is your first day at School, so navigation in the building is a problem for you.
Fortunately, you have a map of the building (fig.~\ref{input}) and additional knowledge about building construction:
\begin{itemize}
  \item there are towers in the school (depicted as nodes of the graph in your map);
  \item towers can be connected by one-way galleries (represented as edges in your map);
  \item galleries have a ``magic'' property: you can start from any floor, but by following each gallery you either end up one floor above (edge label is `a'), or one floor below (edge label is `b'). 
\end{itemize}

You want to find a path from your current position to the same floor in another tower. 
If only you have a map with all such paths.
But orienteering is not your forte, so you prefer the structure of the paths be as simple as possible and all paths to have additional checkpoints to control your route.

It is evident that the simplest structure of required paths is $\{ab, aabb, aaabbb, \dots\}$.
In terms of our definitions, it is necessary to find all paths $p$ such that $\Omega(p) \in \{a^n b^n, n \geq 1\}$ in the graph $M=(\{0;1;2;3\},E,\{a;b\})$ (figure~\ref{input}).

Unfortunately, language $\mathcal{L} = \{a^n b^n; n \geq 1\}$ is not regular which restricts the set of tools you can use. 
Another problem is the infinite size of solution. Being incapable to comprehend infinite set of paths, you want to obtain a finite map.  
Moreover, you want to know the structure of paths in terms of checkpoints.

We are not aware of any existing tools which can solve this problem, except for the one presented in the paper.
Let us show how one can get a map which helps to navigate in this strange School by using our tool. 

Fortunately, the language $\mathcal{L} = \{a^n b^n; n \geq 1\}$ is context-free, thus it can be specified with context-free grammar. 
The fact that one language can be described with multiple grammars allows to add checkpoints: additional nonterminals can mark required subpaths.
In our case, desired checkpoint can be in the middle of the path.
As a result, required language can be specified by the grammar $G_1$ presented in figure~\ref{grammarG}, where $N = \{s; \text{\textit{Middle}}\}$, $\Sigma = \{a; b\}$, and $S$ is a start nonterminal.

Now, let us show that SPPF can be a desired map.
SPPF for the example is presented in figure~\ref{SPPF}.
Each terminal node corresponds to the edge in the input graph: for each node with label $(v_0, T, v_1)$ there is $e\in E: e=(v_0,T,v_1)$.
Extensions stored in SPPF nodes allow us to check whether path from $u$ to $v$ exists and to extract it by SPPF traverse.

    \caption{SPPF and examples of trees for specific paths for data from example (fig~\ref{exampleData}). Redundant nodes are eliminated; terminal nodes are duplicated only for figure simplification.
    We use filled shape and label of form $(<\mkern-11mu | \mkern-11mu> (i, N, j))$ for nonterminal node to denote that there are multiple derivations from nonterminal $N$ for substring $\omega[i..j-1]$. 
    %\\
    %$p_0=\{(0,a,1);(1,a,2);(2,a,0);(0,b,3);(3,b,0);(0,b,3)\}$  \\
    %$p_1=\{(0,a,1);(1,a,2);(2,a,0);(0,a,1);(1,a,2);(2,a,0);(0,b,3);(3,b,0);(0,b,3);\\(3,b,0);(0,b,3);(3,b,0)\}.$

\end{figure*}

To illustrate how to use derivation structure, we can find a middle of any path. It is sufficient to find correspondent nonterminal \textit{Middle} in SPPF for this purpose.
So we can conclude from examining the result that there is only one (common) middle for all results, and it is a vertex with $id = 0$.

Lets find paths $p_i$ such that $S {\xRightarrow[G_1]{}}^{*} \Omega(p_i)$ and $p_i$ starts from the vertex $0$.
To do this, we should find vertices with label $(0, S, \_)$ in SPPF.
(There are two such vertices: $(0, S, 0)$ and $(0, S, 3)$.)
Then let us to extract corresponded paths from SPPF.
There is a cycle in SPPF in our example, so there are \textbf{at least} two different paths: $p_0=\{(0,a,1);(1,a,2);(2,a,0);(0,b,3);(3,b,0);(0,b,3)\}$ and 
$
p_1=\{(0,a,1);(1,a,2);(2,a,0);(0,a,1);(1,a,2);(2,a,0);(0,b,3);(3,b,0);(0,b,3);\\(3,b,0);(0,b,3);(3,b,0)\}.
$ Trees for these paths are presented in figures~\ref{tree1} and~\ref{tree2} respectively.

We demonstrate that SPPF which was constructed by described algorithm can be useful for query result investigation. 
Also, when explicit representation of matched subgraph is preferable, required subgraph may be extracted from SPPF trivially by its traversal.
