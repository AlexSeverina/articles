\section{GLL-based Graph Parsing Algorithm}

We propose a graph parsing algorithm which allows to construct finite representation of parse forest which contains derivation trees for all matched paths in graph.
Finite representation of result set with respect to the specified grammar may be useful not only for results understanding and processing, but also for query debugging. 

Our solution is based on generalized LL (GLL)~\cite{scott2010gll,FastPracticalGLL} parsing algorithm which allows to process arbitrary (including left-recursive and ambiguous) context-free grammars with worst-case cubic time complexity and linear time complexity for LL grammars on a linear input. 

In this section we present such modification of GLL algorithm, that for input graph $M$, set of start vertices $V_s\subseteq V$, set of final vertices $V_f\subseteq V$, and grammar $G_1$, it returns SPPF which contains all derivation trees for all paths $p$ in $M$, such that $\Omega(p) \in L(G_1)$, and $p.start \in V_s,\ p.end \in V_f$.
In other words, we propose GLL-based algorithm which can solve language constrained path problem.

First of all, notice that an input string for classical parser can be represented as a linear graph, and positions in the input are vertices of this graph.
This observation can be generalized to arbitrary graph with remark that for a position there is a set of labels of all outgoing edges for given vertex instead of just one next symbol. 
Thus, in order to use GLL for graph parsing we need to use graph vertices as positions in input and modify \textbf{Processing} function to process multiple ``next symbols''.
Required modifications are presented in the Algorithm~\ref{modifAlgo}~(line \textbf{5} and \textbf{17}).
Small modification is also required for initialization of $R$ set: it is necessary to add not only one initial descriptor but the set of descriptors for all vertices in $V_s$.
All other functions are reused from original algorithm without any changes.

Note that our solution handles arbitrary numbers of start and final vertices, which allows one to solve different kinds of problems arising in the field, namely all paths in graph, all paths from specified vertex, all paths between specified vertices. 
Also SPPF represents a structure of paths in terms of grammar which provides exhaustive information about result. 

Note that termination of proposed algorithm is inherited from the basic GLL algorithm.
We process finite graphs, hence the set of positions is finite, and tree construction has not been changed. 
As a result, the total number of descriptors is finite, and each of them is added in $R$ only once, thus main loop is finite.
