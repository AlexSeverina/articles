\section{Evaluation}

One of classical graph querying problems is a navigation queries for ontologies, and we apply our algorithm to this problem in order to estimate its practical value.
We used dataset from paper~\cite{CFGonRDF}.
Our algorithm is aimed to process graphs, so RDF files were converted to edge-labeled directed graph.
For each triple $(o,p,s)$ from RDF we added two edges: $(o,p,s)$ and $(s,p^{-1},o)$.

We perform two classical \textit{same-generation queries}~\cite{FndDB}, which, for example, is an important part of similarity query to biomedical databases~\cite{GraphQueryWithEarley}.

\textbf{Query 1} is based on the grammar for retrieving concepts on the same layer (presented in figure~\ref{grammarQ1}).
For this query our algorithm demonstrates up to 1000 times better performance and provides identical results as compared to the presented in~\cite{CFGonRDF} for $Q_1$. 

\textbf{Query 2} is based on the grammar for retrieving concepts on the adjacent layers (presented in figure~\ref{grammarQ2}). 
Note that this query differs from the original query $Q_2$ from article~\cite{CFGonRDF} in the following details.
First of all, we count only triples for nonterminal $S$ because only paths derived from it correspond to paths between concepts on adjacent layers.
Algorithm which is presented in~\cite{CFGonRDF} returns triples for all nonterminals.
Moreover, grammar $\mathcal{G}_2$, which is presented in~\cite{CFGonRDF}, describes paths not only between concepts on adjacent layers.
For example, path ``$\text{\textit{subClassOf} \textit{subClassOf}}^{-1}$'' can be derived in $\mathcal{G}_2$, but it is a path between concepts on the same layer, not adjacent.
We changed the grammar to fit a query to a description provided in paper~\cite{CFGonRDF}. 
Thus results of our query is different from results for $Q_2$ which provided in paper~\cite{CFGonRDF}.

All tests were run on a x64-based PC with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz and 32 GB RAM. 
Results of both queries are presented in table~\ref{tbl1}, where \#triples is a number of $(o,p,s)$ triples in RDF file, and \#results is a number of triples of form $(S,v_1,v_2)$.
In our approach result triples can be founded by filtering out all SPPF nonterminal nodes labeled by $(v_1,S,v_2)$.

As a result, we conclude that our algorithm is fast enough to be applicable to some real-world problems.
