Nowadays input data for parsing algorithms is not limited to be linear string, and context-free grammars are used not only for programming languages specification.
One classical example is a context-free path querying for graph data bases where input is a graph and a grammar specifies paths constraints.
Also one can find such generalizations of parsing as multiple input GLL parsing presented at Parsing@SLE-2016 by Elizabeth Scott and Adrian Johnstone, 
Abstract LR parsing~\cite{AbstractParsing} and other thechniques for parsing of dynamically generated strings.

We have some experience in the mentioned areas~\cite{GraphGLL, RelaxedRNGLR}.
GLL-based CF path querying algorithm~\cite{GraphGLL} implemented by the authors is faster than solution which was presented at ISWC-2016~\cite{CFRDFParsing}. 
We have some ideas of application.
For example, context-free pattern search in metagenomical assemblies, which can be applied not only for regular input, but also for CF-compressed input which is actual for metagenomic assembly processing. 
All existing applications look like special cases of the Bar-Hillel~\cite{Bar-Hillel} theorem for CF and regular language intersection, and can be generalized, but today many of them are developed as stand alone solutions.
Thus, the goal of our work is an to create abstract framework for parsing based on geteralization of GLL parsing algorithm~\cite{GLL} which was proposed by Elizabeth Scott and Adrian Johnstone. 
We also want to investigate practical areas of application and create solutions based on our framework to demonstare its practical value.
